<div></div>
<div>
<p>Lead generation (or whatever we're calling it this week) is defined as the generation of consumer interest in a product, service, or business. Of course, SearchDog Marketing is a, well, marketing company, so our interest is to generate new leads for marketing purposes. There are many ways you can get new leads for your business using the Internet. A website is the most obvious way, but it takes a lot more than having a simple website to get people to buy from your business online. </p>
<p>In this blog, I will outline 4 of the worst lead generation techniques I have noticed lately. If you have witnessed anything like this or worse, please share with us all in the comments. The more we share, the more we all learn. So, here it goes....</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Blogging for sales, not social engagement</strong></span><br>The beauty of the Internet is that it gives every person an opportunity to develop a platform of their own. This is also one of the major downsides of the Internet, because too many platforms and voices makes it a very noisy place to engage with potential customers and conduct business. So, how does a business separate themselves from the spammers out there? Sure, you guessed it, establishing a business blog is a great first step. But on this blog, what approach will you take to further separate yourself from the spamming masses? Remember, just because you built it does not automatically mean an audience will follow. In fact, this is quite often NOT the case for amateur business bloggers. Generating leads through a business blog is far from rocket science, but it's a lot more complex than riding a bike. </p>
<p>One of the biggest offenses I see committed in the pursuit of lead generation is businesses that blog for sales and not social engagement. While I admit that the ultimate reason for blogging is to generate more business for your company, there are also many more pieces to this puzzle that must not go ignored. Your blog is your platform, your company's window to the world. You can fill it up with self-absorbed content about your services, products, etc. but would that be an interesting read? Ask yourself that and answer as honestly as your customers would. The Internet is the one place where people feel 100% comfortable being brutally honest about their opinions of everything from politics to peanut butter. </p>
<p>So, before you step into the blogging for business arena, make sure you are there for the right reasons. In case you're still in the dark about what those reasons are, here's a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>To engage with potential and current customers on your turf</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">To give people useful/helpful info</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">To create a forum where people interested in your company can seek answers and ask questions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">To capture new leads for your business in a less obvious and less annoying way</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">To be more personable to the people you do business with</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This list goes on and on depending who you ask, but the list shouldn't be filled with selfish reasons. People can sniff out a spammer or self-absorbed company very fast these days. Don't put your business in negative light by blogging only about your business. It should be about your business and serving the people who make your business possible. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Failing to Keyword Content Across All Platforms</strong></span><br>Using keywords on your website, social media posts and updates is a necessity for any business seeking to have a successful web presence. Here's why: I manage social media for one of our clients and I recently noticed my Google+ posts showing up in Google search results. This isn't by chance or luck. This is directly due to keyword usage in social media updates. I blog for another client's company and noticed those blogs showing up in search engine results when I search using the keywords we identified.</p>
<p>All of our marketing efforts for every client is based on a set of keywords and phrases that are used over and over again. From social media posts to pay-per-click ads, we consistently use the same keywords and measure the effectiveness from beginning to end. This is not anything new, it is the norm. It's also not anything fancy, it's standard Internet and social media marketing practices. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Not Following Up With Emails Collected at Direct Marketing Events</strong></span><br>If you are hosting or participating in an event, then you are conducting direct marketing. It's a strategy, a part of a bigger set of activities that are all focused on generating more business for your company. Nothing should be done in vain or without purpose. Therefore, if you decide to collect email addresses at an event, you MUST follow-up with these people. Not doing so is your first strike in this new relationship with potential customers. </p>
<p>Over the summer, I have attended several festivals and conferences where I signed up for email lists. After signing up for several, I have only received follow-up emails from two organizations to date. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth about these businesses as a consumer and marketer. I question the sincerity of their efforts. But, I'll get off my soapbox and get to the takeaway for businesses. </p>
<p>Follow-up with everyone you encounter. Whether they appeared interested or uninterested in your company, if they sign-up for your email list, email them until they unsubscribe. With that said, there is a such thing as over-emailing and over-communicating. It's a toxic and unsuccessful behavior that will cripple your email marketing campaigns. It's also the next topic up for discussion.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Sending Emails to ALL Clients on Your Email List</span></strong><br>I believe this is the second time I have written about this topic. I stated that to explain that to our regular readers. I apologize for the redundancy, but I am obligated to blog about the things I see businesses doing on a regular basis. There are still people out there who need help and if reemphasizing is helpful, I must oblige. </p>
<p>With that said, if you are sending all emails to every person on your email list, you are most likely experiencing a lack of list growth. Subscribers are jumping ship every time you send an email. In fact, if you are emailing everyone all the time, you probably also not following the other rules of email marketing. Please read some of the blog I've written in the past to help optimize your campaigns for lead generation. Get up to speed before you send ANOTHER EMAIL. </p>
<p>For the purpose of this blog, I will identify a few reasons why you should not send blanket emails to your entire list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone on your email list does not care about everything you have to say at all times. Target your emails to the people who are likely to have an interest in the topic. </li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Emailing people about things they don't care about is considered spam. This is pretty self-explanatory.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Constant unsubscribes weakens the strength of your email list and can jeopardize your account with the MailChimp, ConstantContact or whichever company you use to send emails.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Once someone unsubscribes, you have lost them forever. They may still come to your business, but once they hit the unsubscribe button (or mark you as spam), they are off limits forever. How many people have you lost forever?</p>
<p>So, have you come up with any ideas of similarly bad lead generation techniques? If so, please share in the comments below. I promise I do not write these blogs to pick on anyone. We're all grown ups and when you know better you do better. Isn't that how the old saying goes? That's what this is. An attempt to share lessons learned and reduce any future mistakes. As always, successful marketing strategies and successful business practices are the goal. </p>

      <title>4 Common Local Business SEO Mistakes</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><img id="img-1379076120621" src="/Portals/123780/images/local%20business%20seo%20searchdog%20marketing-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="local business seo searchdog marketing resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> With only 24 hours in a day and 168 hours in a week, it can be difficult to manage all of the marketing activities related to your business that are to keep customers coming and revenue high. One way to manage everything is to develop a local business search engine optimization strategy to take advantage of social, local, and mobile marketing opportunities. Done correctly, local business SEO can generate a constant stream of revenue by connecting your business with a online customer base.</p>
<p>Done incorrectly, it can do more harm than good to your online brand, marketing budget, and perception of what works and does not. What makes it even harder to get SoLoMo marketing right is the huge amount of misinformation available on the subject. Misinformation leads to mistakes, but like most mistakes, they can be avoided. In this blog, we will identify four common SoLoMo marketing mistakes and ways to overcome them.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Mistake #1 - No Official Facebook Page</span></h3>
<p>One of the most common mistakes I see small business owners make is using their Facebook profile for business instead of creating an official Facebook page. Not only do they do a disservice to their business, but also to their customers. Facebook profiles are for personal account holders. When you post status updates and share media like photos and videos from a profile, you are doing so a person, not a business entity. Engaging customers on social media with a profile creates brand confusion and misleads people. Facebook pages are for businesses and come with some pretty sweet analytics and advertising capabilities. Using the data and ads can boost your fan base and extend your reach beyond anything a Facebook profile could ever accomplish. You might be asking yourself why one would use their personal profile instead of a business page. The only reason that comes to mind is sheer laziness, ignorance, and/or trying to utilize their current friend connections to boost their fan base. Rest assured that whatever they have gained using a profile is not nearly as valuable as what they lose by not having a business page.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Mistake #2 - Not Sharing Blog Posts on Social Media</span></h3>
<p>Business blogs have many uses and one of the main ones is to increase website traffic. You can significantly increase your blog hits and website traffic by sharing your blog posts with your social media fans. Now, there is a right way and a wrong way to do this. Your social media accounts should not be a dumping ground for all your blog posts. Create a balance between fun, educational, and sales posts or you will start to resemble a spambot.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Mistake #3 - Failing to Use Keywords in Image File Names</span></h3>
<p>Images add color, life, and balance to marketing, but there is also a SEO benefit. By plugging keywords into file names, search engines give ranking credit for every image file name that includes keywords. For whatever reason, most folks do not take the time to do this very simple activity. If you want to see the impact, go to Google Images and type your company's name into the search box. Now do the same for your top three competitors. If you find nothing for your brand and something for your competitors, you catch my drift. If the experiment failed altogether, search for your favorite brand and see what comes up.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Mistake #4 - Not Spending at Least 15 Minutes A Day On Each Social Media Site </span></h3>
<p>Yes, 15 minutes is a long time if you have several social media sites. But in all honesty, it is not a very long time when you think about the fact that some businesses have full-time positions dedicated to social media. These companies are more successful at social media, because they get what they put into it. Not to say businesses who don't have a full-time position lack the potential to be successful. Quite the opposite in fact. If you plan out your posts in advance and schedule them to release at varying intervals throughout the day. But that is not enough. You need to post a few real-time responses to let your followers know you actually have a pulse. Humanistic marketing makes people love brands. Invest time and you'll see a return.</p>
<p>These four mistakes are really only the tip of the iceberg. I could go on and on, but these are by far the most common mistakes made in the pursuit of SoLoMo success. Each mistake can be easily avoided and fixed with a little planning and time invested. Being successful at marketing does not always require a huge budget. A little knowledge and effort can go a long way.</p>
<p>What are some other common mistakes you have seen or were once guilty of committing?</p>

      <title>How to Integrate Social Media with Your Local Marketing Strategy</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<div>Successfully integrating social media into your overall local marketing strategy can transform the face of your business communications. But why should you bother doing this? How will it improve your business communication efforts? The answer is quite simple, businesses that get social media marketing right usually get customer engagement right. Marketing communications is not a one-way street. It goes two ways and social media is a great way to conduct two-way communications with your customer base. <img id="img-1377224716930" src="/Portals/123780/images/local-marketing-synergy-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="local marketing synergy resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
In this blog, we will explain a few methods to successfully integrate your social media efforts with your local marketing strategy. Hopefully, you have already established a social media presence for your business. Whether you have a Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Foursquare, etc., it is important to understand that social media is much more than establishing an account. It is much more than posting status updates about your latest promotion. Social media is about building and engaging a community of people who love your brand. Yes, you can run advertisements on most social media platforms, but in all honesty, no one will click or buy anything if you fail to do your due diligence.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
Due diligence means integrating social media into your local marketing strategy by truly adopting it as a company priority. Most companies fail at social media because they are in it for the wrong reasons. A few wrong reasons for joining social media are:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Sell products, goods, or services</li>
<li>Tet likes or fans</li>
<li>To look cool</li>
<li>because your competition is doing it</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><span>
If you fall guilty to any of these reasons, do not be alarmed, because you aren't alone. Many businesses get into social media because they want to see a monetary return on their investment. Time and manpower are critical investments that most companies cannot afford to make without seeing a serious return. And that is entirely understandable. Before you can truly expect to see a return, you must take the necessary steps to integrate social media in your marketing strategy in every way possible. First, let's start with some basic methods and then drill down to intermediate to advanced integration methods. </span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><strong>Basic Methods: </strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Add your social media urls and logos to your website, printed materials, etc. Any marketing material your customers receive in your location or through mail. </li>
<li>Cross promote on all your social media accounts. on Facebook, point people to Twitter and vice versa. </li>
<li>Add your social media urls to your receipts. </li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Intermediate Methods: </strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Create content (blogs, SlideShare presentations, infographics, etc.) about your brand and distribute it widely using pay per click advertisements, such as Facebook and Twitter advertising tools. </li>
<li>Advertise your Google+ page and post content consistently.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Advanced Methods: </strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong></strong>Create social media contests and promote via email marketing. </li>
<li>Host virtual events with your VIP customers or new customer base. </li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div>Move beyond the stale status updates and really put yourself out there. It's the only way you will be able to truly engage your customer base with social media. Integrating social media with your local, targeted, on the ground marketing strategy adds credibility to your social media activities.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
Social media cannot be a standalone tactic. Brands who get social media right take their activity beyond the computer screen and weave social media into every logical facet of the communication strategy. It's called synergy and it's totally within your reach. </div>
<div></div>

      <title>How to Leave a Trail of Content Breadcrumbs Back to Your Website</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The whole point of having a website is for people to visit it and buy your products, goods, or services. Then why is it that after spending hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on a beautifully designed website, your web visits and lead conversions are so low? There are many factors, in fact, more than we have time to cover in this particular blog.</p>
<p>The main reason your website has low web visits and lead conversions is that you probably lack a defined strategy to convert web visits into paying clients. Wait, shouldn’t the sheer beauty of your website cast a ‘hurry &amp; buy’ spell on any and all visitors? Not quite. That would make everyone’s lives really simple and our company’s purpose obsolete. <img id="img-1376678054990" src="/Portals/123780/images/Drive-Online-Traffic-to-Small-Business-Website-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Drive Online Traffic to Small Business Website resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></p>
<p>You have to lead people, the <b>right </b>people, to your website if you have any chance of seeing a profit from it. That’s basically what inbound marketing is all about – leading people to your website to turn a profit. But how can you lead them there?</p>
<p>One good way to lead people to your website is to pull them in from other websites. In this blog, we will give you a few pointers on strategies to help you lead a trail of content breadcrumbs to lure visitors back to your website.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>List your website on online directories</b></span></p>
<p>It may not seem like there’s a huge reason to sign up for directory listings, but there’s a hidden carrot for doing so. Submitting your website to web directories means you receive backlinks to your site, which is just one more way to get found online. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Comment on high traffic blogs and leave your web address</b></span></p>
<p>Again, this may not seem like it has a huge return, but leaving thoughtful, meaningful comments on high-traffic blogs is a great way to get noticed by people in your field. It also helps position you as a thought-leader on a particular topic. Whether you agree or disagree with the perspectives in the blog, make sure your response isn’t frivolous. Put a little meat on it and you just may get a reply back from the author, which further strengthens your credibility.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Start a LinkedIn Group</b></span></p>
<p>This is not the first time I have suggested starting a community group on LinkedIn. I do so adamantly because I believe in the power of LinkedIn groups. Not just for content curation, but for making meaningful connections and crowdsourcing benefits. Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of stale, inactive groups filled with spammers out there. However, there are just as many meaningful groups out there with members who are looking for a interesting, industry specific dialogue. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Answer &amp; Ask Questions in Established LinkedIn Groups</b></span></p>
<p>It’s not only a good idea to start your own LinkedIn group, but you should also engage in already established groups. Answering questions people ask in groups provides a legitimate Segway to the products and services you provide. In this forum, a sales pitch is inappropriate. Strive to be helpful and ask for nothing in return. Making meaningful connections is not always about someone buying something right away. Think about the lifetime value of a meaningful interaction. The next time someone has a question, they may come directly to you instead of posting in a group.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Start a Google+ Group &amp; Organize a Hangout</b></span></p>
<p>If you haven’t identified the theme of this blog, it’s gaining web visits by making connections in other places online. A relatively new place to make connections online is through Google+ Groups. While they aren’t as well populated as some LinkedIn Groups, there are lots of potential customers and industry professionals present in that space. </p>
<p>There are many non-traditional ways to get a targeted segment to visit your website. It won’t happen over night, not with paid ads or organic methods. Everything takes time. The important takeaway to remember is that if you’re not genuine in your pursuits, the public will be able to tell. No matter how fancy your website is, it won’t automatically attract the right group of visitors. You have to know where they congregate online and plant yourselves in those communities. </p>

      <title>How to Get Leads with PPC - A Beginners Guide</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>With all the buzz around internet marketing and pay per click advertising, it can be difficult for business owners to decide which route leads to marketing success. Pay per click advertising is a great way to generate new leads, but it can also be very expensive if you are not experienced in managing them. <img id="img-1375985059800" src="/Portals/123780/images/how%20to%20get%20leads%20with%20ppc-resized-600.gif" border="0" alt="how to get leads with ppc resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></p>
<p>In this blog, we will discuss ways to make the most of <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/ppc-pay-per-click-internet-marketing" title="pay per click advertising" target="_self">pay per click advertising</a> budget. The tips provided in this blog can be applied to Google Adwords, Yahoo, Bing, etc. Before we go down this road, keep in mind that you are completely in control of PPC campaigns. You choose the keywords, you choose which landing page it points to, you choose the audience who sees the ads. Being in complete control means you take complete responsibility for the campaign’s success or failure. It is possible to learn how to manage PPC ads without enlisting an expert’s help, but as with any newly learned skill, it takes time, commitment, and focus to see the results your business needs. </p>
<p>With that said, let’s discuss how to get leads with PPC:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Brainstorm a list of relevant and realistic keywords</b></span> – As with most Internet marketing campaigns, PPC ad success centers on having a core list of keywords. Without that, you are shooting in the dark with no real target in sight. <span style="font-size: 13px;">To start a focused keyword brainstorming session, you must first ask yourself ‘how will my customers search for my business online?’ Name 4-5 logical phrases your customers would use to locate your business or similar businesses. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">For example, if you own a pet grooming business in Dallas, a few phrases could be: dog grooming in Dallas, best pet groomer in Dallas, affordable pet grooming services, etc. </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">Now that you have a basic list to work from, go to your Google Analytics (assuming you have this in place) and review the keywords visitors use to find your website. Compare that list to yours and make changes to create a final list. Working from a basic list is always good because it will either support or destroy the notions you have about your own customer’s behavior.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em; color: #800000;"><b>Check keyword rank, difficulty, search traffic, and bidding prices in Adwords </b></span><span style="font-size: 1em;">– The best way to determine if a keyword is worth it, is to check its status in Adwords. There you can plug in a keyword to verify it’s rank, difficulty, search traffic, and how much it’ll cost you. Some keywords/phrases will have high search traffic, but be very difficult to rank for. Others will be the exact opposite. You will be forced to make some tough decisions, so choose your battles wisely. I suggest taking a long, hard look at your competitor’s website to identify some obvious keywords they are ranking for.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Stick to the suggested bid or bid more </b></span><span style="font-size: 1em;">– A frequent mistake made when in PPC management is under bidding. PPC ads differ from print ads in that you have complete control over your ad spend. You can decide how much to pay for a click, how much you want to spend per day, and your overall budget. Do yourself a favor and stick to the suggested bid or bid more than that. Doing less than what’s suggested in a sure way to guarantee no one will see your ads.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Create customized landing pages</b></span><span style="font-size: 1em;"> – A very amateur mistake that’s constantly made by marketing DIYer’s is sending PPC ads to their website’s homepage. An ad should be a part of a much larger campaign that is tracked from start to finish. It’s hard to track how many people visited your website or bought a certain product if your ad links directly to your home page. Solve this by creating customized landing pages for each PPC ad offer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Know what you don’t know </b></span><span style="font-size: 1em;">– The most frustrating thing about being a marketer is working with clients who think they know it all. Doing your research on the front end (i.e. reading this blog) is a good step to scratching the surface of untapped knowledge, but blogs won’t give you experience. The fact is that you don’t have time to master marketing. You’re busy running your business, managing employees, and satisfying customers. But at the very least, be aware of what your business needs to succeed. Every business needs a marketing plan. Every business needs a website. Every business needs to advertise. Leave the strategy and tactics to an honest professional or you will waste time and money reinventing a well-established wheel.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you feel up to the challenge of creating PPC ads, go for it. If you’d rather not take on another project, give us a call and we’ll take care of the heavy lifting. If nothing else, hopefully, you learned a bit about how to optimize your PPC ads to get leads.</p>

      <title>Inbound Marketing for Startups: Tips &amp; Tricks to Get Noticed</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p dir="ltr"><span>The ever-increasing number of new startups launching each day makes marketing more challenging than ever before. It’s getting harder to keep your company top of mind among consumers. That’s the bad news. The good news is that you can reach your target audience by tapping into the great equalizer - Inbound marketing for startups.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Internet%20Marketing%20for%20Startups-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Internet Marketing for Startups resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>That seems like a pretty obvious move every startup, but not everyone approaches the goal in a strategic AND creative way. Most new startups are strapped for cash, so going all out on an online advertising campaign is not even an option. Luckily, there are many free to reasonably priced methods to get your startup noticed by the people who need your products and services.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Before we jump into the nitty gritty, let’s cover some must-have information before lifting a finger in the Inbound marketing for startups direction. </span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #800000;">Know Your Target Consumer</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Saying this never gets old, because it is always </span><span>necessary</span><span>. And it goes for those who have been in business for years and those who are just now getting off the ground. Failing to have a strong grasp on who your audience is will cost your time, money, and manpower.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Finding out who your audience is should be very simple – it’s who needs your product or service most and who will help your business become established and grow. Using Inbound marketing strategies makes targeting the right audience easier and cost efficient than traditional methods. </span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #800000;">Create a Responsive, SEO Friendly Web Site</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Nowadays, people access websites from a number of devices, platforms, and browsers. In order for you to put your best foot forward, your startup’s website must be accessible through them all. They find new websites organically through search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing using keywords. Which is why your website should be both responsive and search engine optimization friendly. If you’re skeptical about how important it truly is, go log into Google Analytics and take a peek at your bounce rate. Then look at the devices that have accessed your website. If your site is nonresponsive, you’re no doubt deterring visitors from staying on your site.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #800000;">Submit to Public Listings</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr">It’s always a good idea to sign up for tech public listing sites like TechCrunch and Hacker News. Not only can you find a good pool for beta testers, but also angel investors! We found a pretty long list of<a href="http://www.inboundio.com/blog/51-inbound-marketing-ways-to-market-your-startup-and-business-on-shoestring-budget/"> listings for startups</a>, so take your time and decide which are worth your time. </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #800000;">Connect with Other Startups</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The great and not so great thing about being a new start up is that you are one of many others trying to stake a claim in the marketplace. Competition is a gift and a curse, but there’s plenty of room for new tech companies to flourish. So, why not network with your competition? Forge a strategic partnership with a complementary business. Make sure there’s something worthwhile in it for you both. Think referral fees and cross web promotions. Or sharing a booth at a local festival (if that’s allowed).</span> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #800000;">Create Lots and Lots of Shareable Content</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This isn’t about establishing a social media presence would be pretty basic. Of course, you will have a Facebook and Twitter. Maybe a Pinterest and Instagram depending on how much your startup lends itself to visual storytelling. Which brings me to my next point, creating shareable content is about telling your story. That’s the only thing that separates you from the next guy who offers what you offer. Yeah, sure, maybe your approach is new and novel, but that alone won’t make people like you enough to keep you top of mind. And that’s what Inbound marketing for startups is all about – staying top of mind.</span> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The best types of sharable content are fun, brief, easy to access across all platforms, and relatable. Looping Vine videos, filtered behind the scenes Instagram photos and videos, and original memes. Embed them in a short blog post on your website.</span> </p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #800000;">Host an Expo or Competition</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Organizing industry events is a very underutilized strategy by startups and we’re not quite sure why. The benefit seems fairly obvious – face-to-face contact with other startups, media coverage, and the attention of potential investors. Hosting an expo or competition also presents your startup as a leader among your peers and external audiences. But how does this offline engagement benefit Inbound marketing for startups?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Any well-planned event, whether it’s a hack-a-thon or baking contest, will have a sign-up sheet. Collecting contact information for everyone who attends is the beginning of a powerful email list of people you KNOW belong to your target audience. When it comes time to start email campaigns and build your social media presence, that list will come in handy once again.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Remember, no matter what anyone says or does, your presence offline and direct engagement with your target audience (or lack thereof) matters to your marketing success. No amount of advertising or blogging can make up for this.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">These are a few low-cost Inbound marketing strategies for startups. Nothing too fancy or costly. It's totally possible to have a great marketing plan without breaking the bank. </p>

	<p>It's no secret that the key to a successful search engine optimization campaign is a well-planned keyword strategy. </p>
<p>Successful local business SEO strategy depends on having the ability to research keywords, identify new keywords, analyze traffic, and select budgets.  </p>
<p>Many SEO's relied on Google's Keyword Tool and Traffic Estimator to satisfy this need, but since the local search giant <a href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2013/05/introducing-keyword-planner-combining.html" title="axed those tools" target="_self">axed those tools</a>, we've all turned to the newly launched <a href="http://adwords.google.com/keywordplanner" title="Keyword Planner" target="_self">Keyword Planner</a> tool. </p>
<p>In this blog, we will explain a bit about the differences between the old and the new tool. We'll also discuss what this tool means for local business SEO, because that's what we do best. Help businesses reach their audiences online, near or far. But for the purposes of this blog, we'll hone in on how this tool enhances local business SEO specifically.</p>
<img id="img-1373558469606" src="/Portals/123780/images/Local%20Business%20SEO%20Tool%20-%20Keyword%20Ideas-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Local Business SEO Tool   Keyword Ideas resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Out With the Old</b></span></p>
<p>Now that Google's Keyword Tool and Traffic Estimator are history, everyone needs to get acquainted with the new tool's interface, capabilities, and features. The major difference between Keyword Planner (KP) and the old tools is that KP combines both tools and is solely focused on making it easier for advertisers to create new ad groups and campaigns. The creation of both items is essential for the start of a <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/ppc-pay-per-click-internet-marketing" title="solid PPC campaign" target="_self">solid PPC campaign</a>.  </p>
<p>The old tools were more general in purpose and not well structured. KP, on the other hand, is finely built to streamline the process of building an Adwords campaign from scratch or your existing keyword list. <a href="http://searchengineland.com/how-to-use-the-keyword-planner-the-new-keyword-tool-from-google-adwords-157123">Search Engine Land </a>calls the KP Tool's interface "wizard-like," because it takes all of the guesswork out of PPC campaigns.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>New &amp; Improved Features</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Research keywords or refine existing campaigns to discover more efficient keywords</li>
<li>Target cities, regions, languages, and networks</li>
<li>Filter results by number of average monthly searches, CPCs and competition</li>
<li>Hide keywords that already on your existing list</li>
<li>Combine multiple keyword lists to generate new keywords</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Local%20Business%20SEO%20Tool%20-%20ad%20groups-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Local Business SEO Tool   ad groups resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>What This Means for Local Business SEO</b></span></p>
<p>Keyword Planner likely means a change in workflow for advertisers and SEOs. Using Google’s previous tools did not provide the necessary information to research, target, estimate, and plan a PPC campaign.</p>
<p>Remember, before you jump head first into Keyword Planner, do your prep work. Yes, Google’s tool provides keyword data, but you should come to the table with your own data. You should have your existing keyword list used on other campaigns. If you are new to online advertising, access your Google Analytics data to see what keywords are already being used to drive traffic to your website. </p>
<p>Now if you want to target other keywords and discover some new ones, here are a few other tools to use for this purpose. Try Mike Blumenthal’s Category Tool, Local Marketing Source’s Keyword Research Tool, <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/keyword-niche-finder">Keyword Niche Finder</a>, and <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/keyword-grouping">Keyword</a> Grouping tools.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Local%20Business%20SEO%20-%20Performance%20Estimates-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Local Business SEO   Performance Estimates resized 600"></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Why Use Keyword Planner</b></span></p>
<p>If you’re new to internet marketing and <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="search engine optimization," target="_self">search engine optimization,</a> you may be asking yourself why you should even care about Google’s Keyword Planner tool. Creating an ad in Adwords Express is super easy and they find all the keywords for you automatically, right? Well, that’s true, but Adwords Express only scratches the surface. If you truly want to unlock you PPC potential, you should be using the full-fledged Adwords product. You will have much more control over your ad word groups and your ads themselves.</p>
<p>Not only that, Keyword Planner (and tools like it) provide critical information for your PPC campaign. The simple fact is that no amount of strategy or automation makes up sloppy keyword selection. If your list sucks, so will your campaign. Which is money wasted. The more research you do on the front end, the more optimized your campaigns will be and the more ROI you can expect.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Sorry Kids, It’s Only Available in Limited Beta</b></span></p>
<p>Hopefully, by now you’re sold on Keyword Planner and understand what it does. So, you want to check it out, right? Well, you can hurry up and wait, because it’s only available in limited beta. It’s no surprise that not everyone can access Keyword Planner. That’s why we’ve provided so many screenshots from the lucky few who posted blogs from their accounts. </p>
<p>We’ll keep you posted on Google updates and local business SEO strategies. In the meantime, if you have access to Keyword Planner, tell us what you think and if you’re using it along with other tools.</p>

      <title>June 2013: Social Media Marketing Recap</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<div>Unless you've been living under a very large rock for the past month, you noticed a lot has happened this month in the world of social media. Between Facebook and Twitter updates, there is a lot to review and integrate into your social media strategy. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I<span style="font-size: 1em;">n this blog, we'll give a brief overview of what's transpired over the past three weeks. Over the next few blogs, we'll dissect each update and announcement. Here's what you missed this month. We'll start with the biggest player in the room - Facebook.</span>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Facebook Introduces Hashtags</strong></div>
<div><strong><img id="img-1372680375669" src="/Portals/123780/images/facebook-hashtag-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="facebook hashtag resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>This came as no surprise to anyone. Facebook is slowly (as always) rolling out hashtags to its users in an effort to "bring conversations back to the forefront." The same concept and idea as with Twitter and Google+. Users click on hashtags to find other related content around that keyword. Longterm, Facebook plans to connect hashtags with paid ads and have trending hashtags. Here's more info on <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/633/Public-Conversations-on-Facebook" shape="rect" target="_blank">Facebook Hashtags</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Facebook Gives Sponsored Stories, Questions, and Offers the Boot</strong></div>
<div>The big wigs at Facebook finally realized they offer too many advertising products. Among other things, the sheer number of options available was confusing to marketers. Three ad products got chopped: Sponsored Stories, Questions, and Offers. Check with <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/facebook-kills-sponsored-stories" shape="rect" target="_blank">Hubspot</a> for more details. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Twitter Unlocks Analytics to All Users</strong></div>
<div>Finally! Twitter made the move we have all been anxiously awaiting since for many years. They unlocked analytics that allow all users to view and analyze the tweet performance. To access your analytics, visit <span> </span><a href="http://ads.twitter.com/" shape="rect" target="_blank">http://ads.twitter.com</a> and log-in using your credentials. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Facebook Launches Video on Instagram</strong></div>
<div>Not willing to be left out of the video fun, Facebook delivered on a highly anticipated upgrade to Instagram - <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/facebook-launches-video-instagram-weekly-marketing-stories">video and filtering capability</a>. Instagram users now have the ability to take 15 second videos and share directly on the news feed of their current followers. The clear advantage to sharing video on Instagram instead of Vine is the difference in audiences and cross-platform sharing. Most users have bigger followings on Instagram, so they get more engagement there. Not to mention the Facebook integration expands their reach even wider. Take that Vine. </div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Vine Adds New Features</strong></div>
<div>Hoping to fend off Facebook's Instagram update, Vine added a few new features to the mix. They changes included a redesigned video stream and the ability to save draft versions of video. That's huge for early adapters who have been itching for a way to save their cool Vines before sharing. Soon after this update was leaked to media Facebook announced the video update to Instagram. It's still unclear how Vine will survive now that Facebook has upped the ante, but many <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/18/vine-will-survive/">Vine loyalists</a> are confident in its survival. Only time will tell. </div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Facebook Rolls Out New and Improved Business Analytics</strong></div>
<div>
<strong></strong>Late last month, Facebook refreshed their <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/facebook-revamps-business-page-insights">business analytics</a> to make things clearer for advertisers to understand the impact of their dollars. "People Talking About Us" was always a slightly vague and ambigious metric. If you were confused about its meaning, you're not alone. So they broke it down into five different metrics and they are: </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Page Likes</span></li>
<li>
<span>People Engaged (the number of unique people who have clicked on, </span><span>Liked, </span><span>commented on, or shared your posts)</span>
</li>
<li><span>Page Tags and Mentions</span></li>
<li><span>Page Checkins</span></li>
<li><span>Other interactions on a Page</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<strong><br></strong>Much clearer. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The metric "Virality" got renamed as "Engagement Rate and  it now takes clicks into consideration. Before this, Virality measured how many stories (likes, comments, shares) were created from a single post. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Another much appreciated update to Business Analytics is the individualized post data, which makes it easier to understand the impact of a single post. Before this update, it wasn't possible to see a clear, consolidated snapshot of one post. Hubspot shows us what it looks like:</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Lastly, Facebook made it easier to understand exactly which people you engaged by adding a simple "People Engaged" section. It gives a demographic breakdown of who you reached, thus making it easier to identify which types of content resonate with what audiences. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The new and improved Business Analytics definitely helps marketers connect the dots by painting a clearer picture of ROI and engagement. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Twitter's Viacom Deal Gains Traction</strong></div>
<div>
<strong></strong>Last, but certainly not least (in our book anyway), is Twitter's very intriguing <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/06/19/twitter-takes-another-step-toward-television-with-viacom-deal/">Viacom deal</a>. It's on the horizon, but it's still unclear exactly what this means for the future of social media. Other than a lot of TV to your Twitter stream. It appears the folks at Twitter have a different vision for the future of video and social media advertising. It involves Vine and real-time videos during TV networks like Viacom, NBC, and the BBC. Twitter's Amplify platform packs a punch that Instagram video simply does not (at this point anyway). </div>
<div></div>
<div>Twitter &amp; Viacom plan to launch their partnership at the 2013 MTV Music Video Awards at Brooklyn's Barclay Center on August. 25. This will mark the first of many collaborations and real-time, behind the scenes footage of Viacom's hit programming. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>That wraps it the June 2013 Social Media Recap. Wonder what the month of July holds for social media marketing...let's see! </div>

      <title>How to Capture Email Addresses Using Twitter's Lead Generation Cards</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p class="p1">Up until now, getting medium to small sized business owners excited about advertising on Twitter has been an uphill battle. The sheer vastness of Twitter's audience pool, number of fake accounts, and advertising costs make Twitter ads less attractive for companies with slim marketing budgets. </p>
<p class="p1">Over the past year, Twitter's made significant strides towards diversifying their ad offerings and making the cost more reasonable across the board. <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards"><span class="s1">Twitter Cards</span></a> are a feature available to a select group of advertisers that makes it possible to attach media experiences to tweets that link back to your content.<span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Twitter offers 7 types of cards. They are: </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3">
<span class="s2"><b></b><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Summary Card</b></span></a></span></span>: Default card, including a title, description, thumbnail, and Twitter account attribution.</li>
<li class="li3">
<span class="s2"><b></b><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Large Image Summary Card</b></span></a></span></span>: Similar to a Summary Card, but offeres the ability to prominently feature an image.</li>
<li class="li3">
<span class="s2"><b></b><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Photo Card</b></span></a></span></span>: A Tweet sized photo card.</li>
<li class="li3">
<span class="s2"><b></b><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Gallery Card</b></span></a></span></span>: A Tweet card geared toward highlighting a collection of photos.</li>
<li class="li3">
<span class="s2"><b></b><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/app-card"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>App Card</b></span></a></span></span>: A Tweet card for providing a profile of an application.</li>
<li class="li3">
<span class="s2"><b></b><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Player Card</b></span></a></span></span>: A Tweet sized video/audio/media player card.</li>
<li class="li3">
<span class="s2"><b></b><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Product Card</b></span></a></span></span>: A Tweet card to better represent product content.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The 7th and most recently added one is the Lead Generation Card. It allows marketers to capture customer email addresses directly from a tweet. Why is this important, you ask? And what's it in for marketers? </p>
<p class="p1">The Lead Generation Card shortens the conversion path for users by removing a couple of steps. Users no longer have to click a link, be sent to a landing page, and fill out a form. The new Twitter Card automatically populates a users name, Twitter handle, and email address, so it's less work for them. Email address are securely and privately without being exposed to everyone on Twitter. This way, users can rest assured that they won't receive lots of spam. </p>
<p class="p2">Here's what it looks like:</p>
<p class="p2"><img id="img-1370016354837" src="/Portals/123780/images/Twitter's%20Lead%20Generation%20Card%20-%20Inbound%20Marketing-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Twitter's Lead Generation Card | Inbound Marketing" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1">This new addition to Twitter Cards is a very exciting development for inbound marketers. While currently it's only available to Twitter's managed advertising clients, the company promises to roll it out to <a href="/local-business-marketing-services/" title="small and medium-sized businesses" target="_blank">small and medium-sized businesses</a> very soon. </p>
<p class="p1">Having a lead generation capability solves the issue of how to get the email addresses of the following you've worked so hard to amass. Sadly, a large social media following does not translate directly to sales. As sad as that may be for some of you hard and fast, bottom-line types, it's important to remember that social media is as much a public relations tool as it is a marketing tool. Pinpointing a quantifiable value of every social media effort would be great and there are some tools out that try to nail down that value. They value of engagement lies in brand awareness and lead generation potential, which Twitter has introduced with their Twitter Cards offering. </p>
<p class="p1">Twitter's already seen some success with the Lead Generation card. Brands like NewRelic (@newrelic), Full Sail (@fullsail), and PriceLine (@priceline) report experiencing deeper interactions with customers as a result of using the new card. Although this feature is still in BETA testing and will undergo multiple iterations and improvements before being further released, it doesn't hurt to start the conversation about the future potential it holds. </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Monetizing Email Addresses</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Not all businesses take the time to monetize customer email addresses through an inbound marketing campaign. In fact, doing a sloppy job at an inbound marketing campaign actually does more harm than good. When potential customers take the time to fill out a form online they aren't doing it for fun. They expect to get something in return. Inbound marketing campaigns seek to generate leads in a quid quo pro type fashion. In exchange for their personal information, people expect quality content, discount/coupons, contest entry, etc. What they get depends on your ability to follow-up consistenly. Failure to do so can hurt your brand and revenue. </p>
<p class="p1">So take some time now to think long and hard on the benefits of inbound marketing and lead generation. If you're already on board, examine your strategy's pain points and see what you can do to take advantage of the opportunity that's on the horizon. Until then, be on the look out for big brands trying to gather your email addresses! We'll be taking notes on their approaches to come up with best practices!</p>

      <title>What Google's Penguin 2.0 Update Means for SEOs</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p class="p1">If you noticed a major change in your website's traffic this month, Google's recent Penguin 2.0 update is to blame. </p>
<p class="p1">Whether you saw a boost or a decline in web traffic depends on how Google views the quality of your site content. The May 2013 Penguin update continues the company's onslaught against spam and black hat search engine optimization tactics. While the updates will hit some harder than others, all in all, it is only estimated to impact roughly 2.3% of Google's English search queries. <img id="img-1369831637228" src="/Portals/123780/images/No-Spam-Can-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="penguin 2.0 update attacks spammers" width="170" height="170" class="alignCenter" style="height: 170px; width: 170px; float: left;"></p>
<p class="p1">But, why the strong arming tactics? Why not just shut down sites altogether? It's pretty simple. Google wants to make sure users are receiving the best possible content. They don't mean to make your life a living hell, but as Matt Cutts said in a<a href="http://%3Ciframe%20width=%22560%22%20height=%22315%22%20src=%22http://www.youtube.com/embed/xQmQeKU25zg%22%20frameborder=%220%22%20allowfullscreen%3E%3C/iframe%3E"><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s2">video</span></a> released by Google explaining the effects of Penguin 2.0, "As long as you're working hard for users, we're working hard to try to show your quality content to users as well." The best way to ensure that businesses are serving up delicious content is keep raising the bar. </p>
<p class="p1">Cutts warns that things are still "in flux" and not to take these changes as the final word. "If you're doing high quality whenever you're doing SEO, this changes shouldn't be a big surprise." Very true, it is not a big surprise, but reporting on these updates help business owners and marketers understand the importance of high quality content in your inbound marketing strategy. </p>
<p class="p1">New Changes Include: </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Spam-Fighting Technology</b> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Targeting advertorials was the first thing Matt Cutts mentioned in the video. It's no wonder. Back in February, Google penalized <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-dishes-out-pagerank-penalties-to-uk-newspaper-web-sites-for-selling-links-149333"><span class="s2">UK newspapers</span></a> and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/after-penalizing-interflora-uk-newspapers-google-warns-against-advertorials-149371"><span class="s2">Interflora</span></a> for selling links on sites that bypass PageRank. They've made it very clear that advertorials are a clear violation of their policies, but I, like others, find myself landing on these types of pages. </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Spam Queries</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Google's taking a closer look at spammy queries such as "pay day loans" or pornographic terms. </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Upstream Approach</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">They're taking a more proactive approach spam links by discrediting link value of the gained from spam sources and blocking future credits from similar sources. </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Link Analysis Software</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Cutts said Google is in the early stages of developing an improved link analysis solution. </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Authority Boost</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Websites that are authorities in specific niche industries are being identified to receive an boost in SERP visibility. This update will check content to measure trust and examine link profiles. Once authority is determined, these sites receive more credit. </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Increased Communication with Web Masters</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Google promises to keep in contact with web masters more through the portal. So, if there's an issue with hacking or another problem, web masters always have that go-to location to receive help from the Google team. <span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">There are a few more changes involved with this update, but these are the major ones you need to be aware of. <span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Watch the video below to here Matt Cutts' talk in detail.</p>

<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>What Does the Penguin 2.0 Update Mean for SEOs and Marketers?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Essentially this update means what Google has been telling us all along. Produce more quality content with the user in mind and you will rank higher in SERPs and PageRank strengthens. </p>
<p class="p1">But how do you know if your PageRank sucks or is in good shape? It's an easy and relatively quick fix to find out. If you're using Chrome (which makes life easier overall), go to the App Store and search for PageRank. Download it and follow instructions. You should be able to check the PageRank of any website you visit. This is a powerful tool for marketers who have to justify website strategy changes. </p>

      <title>Part 4 | Measurement | The Content Marketing Roadmap for Busy Inbound Marketers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Measuring the success of a marketing campaign is always the last step in the Content Marketing Institute's framework, but it is also the most important. In fact, tracking your content's effectiveness should happen continuously throughout the span of your efforts - beginning, middle, and end. </p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/cmi%20content%20marketing-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="content marketing institute framework" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>While measurement is the important, it is sometimes hard for marketers to prove. With so many metrics to consider, it can be confusing to decide which metrics really matter to your bottom-line. After all, your boss probably thinks likes and re-tweets are frivolous. In order to make the boss understand the big picture, you have to present the case for content marketing strategically. In this blog, we will help you develop a sound justification for content marketing. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Align your content marketing goals with your overall business goals</b></span></p>
<p>This must happen during the beginning stages of the content marketing framework. CMI lists the core business rationales for content marketing as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expand prospect and customer base</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support entire purchase process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aid search marketing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build relationships with fans, advocates and the general public</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor and/or enhance your reputation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you meet with the boss and he/she wants to know how content marketing aligns with the businesses bottom-line, the above listing is a great start. They are specific enough for you to draw clear parallels between both efforts, yet general enough for you to allow you enough latitude to tweak your content if necessary.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Measure what matters to the bottom-line</b></span></p>
<p>When we say bottom-line, we are referring to expenses, actions, brand impact, and expenses. The stuff that matters to the sales department and executives. Here are the types of questions you need to have answers for (according to CMI):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What’s working and isn’t working?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What needs to be happening?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many purchases did the content marketing drive?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenues per reader?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many readers took some type of action during the content process? Ex. How many signed up for an e-book?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much did it cost to drive sales? Consider all aspects of marketing such as content creation, technical support, and media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many customers mention your brand, products, and company? Measure the overall brand sentiment and tell how the company responds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content views and downloads?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time spent on site/page?<span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are other metrics you need to account for, then add those to the list. Ask your boss what matters to him. You may or may not be able to wiggle these things into your content goals, but it’s worth a try.<span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<p>CMI gives a quote in their framework that really resonates and speaks to the heart of measurement.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-24%20at%209.53.24%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="content marketing institute quote" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>With that said, take the results of your measurement and go back to the planning stage armed with the right data to make the right moves. </p>

      <title>Part 3: The Content Marketing Roadmap for Busy Inbound Marketers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p class="p1">Happy Hump Day to all our fellow marketers out there. Today, we are mosey on with our analysis of content marketing titled <em>Part 3: The Content Marketing Roadmap for Busy Inbound Marketers.</em></p>
<p class="p2">Parts 1 and 2 covered the introductory and intermediate stages of the roadmap: Plan, Audience, Story, and Channels. Now on to <b>Process</b> and <b>Conversations</b>. </p>
<p class="p3"> <img id="img-1369246997677" src="/Portals/123780/images/cmi%20content%20marketing-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="content marketing guide flow chart by CMI" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Process</b><span class="s1"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1">As with any journey, you need a roadmap to guide you to your destination. After determining where you want to go (audience/strategy) and what you want to do along the way (story/channels), you have to actually decide on the best route to travel. Be strategic about your content marketing from every possible aspect, from planning to implementation, and you can reach your goals faster. Developing a thorough implementation plan to continuously create and publish content is the crux of the Process stage. </p>
<p class="p1">Here are things to consider:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<p>Assign roles and responsibilities - who handles what.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<p>Make a schedule with publishing times best for your content and audience  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<p>Establish your brand tone and guidelines for engaging customers  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">CMI suggests you "think of an output as a 'playbook' that any new member of your content team would want." </p>
<p class="p1">Here at SearchDog, we write our own content and work with companies like Writer Access to find freelance writers to do our clients content. We develop content marketing strategies for clients in-house and shop out pieces to writers. Saves time and it allows us to streamline our workflow, so we never neglect our own content or that of our clients. It took a while to figure out a system that would work, but it happened.  </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Conversations</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Once your process is organized and streamlined, you're all done, right? Wrong! Content in itself will not yield the results you want, no matter how awesome it is. As marketers, we know that the two-way communication is necessary to really connect and engage with the intended audience. The key word here is authentic and since your content does the talking, make certain it's on topic and the <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2012/06/content-we-crave/"><span class="s2">type of content</span></a> consumers actually want. </p>
<p class="p1">If you jump into LinkedIn groups with a stale sales pitch, no one's going to talk to you. Most likely, you will get booted from the group for spamming. Instead, let's use the information we have compiled on audiences and jump into conversations with consumers. For starters, conduct two-way communication with NO links to your website. But try listening before you jump into a discussion. See who the consistent players are and what the 'rules of the road' are for different platforms. It sounds a little bit like stalking, but we prefer the terms 'listening' or 'monitoring.' </p>
<p class="p1">Listening is a huge part of content marketing success. Without a strong grasp of what is already being said about your industry or products/services, you won't be able to align your content with the current need in the market. Not listening also makes your comments seem disingenuous. If you don't see any conversations relevant to your products or services, plant a few listening posts. CMI wrote a helpful post with tips on <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2011/11/tips-for-better-listening-content-marketing/"><span class="s2">listening</span></a>, so look into it. </p>
<p class="p1">Listening is only half of the job. You have to come up with responses to the posts. Dialogue with consumers in a way that is transparent, honest, and helpful. Not pushy or forced. Make notes of where you have responded, so you can monitor the posts activity. LinkedIn makes this really easy, because users can be emailed every time someone comments on a post. Facebook is the same. Twitter is a bit more complex, but not hard to track conversations. Google Alerts are also a good tool to search for specific content on the web. </p>
<p class="p1">Now that we've broken down the <b>Process</b> and <b>Conversations</b> stages of the roadmap, we'll conclude this series tomorrow with the last, but certainly not least important stage -<b>Measurement</b>. We know you're really busy, hence the title of this series, but the last stage is arguably the <em>most</em> important, so stay tuned.</p>

      <title>Google+ Improvements Bring a Fresh, New Look, Photo Editing &amp; Seam</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	The new and improved Google+ is already making national headlines in the blogsphere since it was unveiled earlier this week at Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O. <br> <br>Sadly, no announcements were made about new hardware releases, so don't expect to have any rumors of a Phone X confirmed or denied in this post. However, we will discuss the latest improvements to Google+ including the new look and plans to dominate the social space by leveraging their all-knowing data center. <br><p><a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2013/05/google-upgrade.html" target="_self"><img id="img-1368799686452" src="/Portals/123780/images/google--upgrades-557x302-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="google  upgrades 557x302 resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></a></p>
<p>Whether you agree or disagree with Google+'s ability to outsocial Facebook in the short or longterm is not of real importance. Once you digest the vision of how Google plans to use its combined network of 580 million Google+ and Google account holders, you might just choke on previous claims of the sites lack of relevancy in social media. </p>
<p><br><span style="color: #800000;">Introducing the New &amp; Improved Google+</span><br>More than 41 new features were annouced at Google's IO. In this three-minute video, a reporter from <em>The Verge </em>sits down with the ring leader of Google+ Vic Gundotra. He speaks of Google+ as the company's 'social spine' with their powerful and all-knowing data center at the heart of it all. <span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span><br> <br><script type="text/javascript" src="http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=dcc84e41db014454b08662a766057e2b&amp;ec=twamFuYjqNwZc8LV2OpopNCTUdBzVBtw"></script><br>Now that you got the scope directly from 'the horses mouth' as they say, let's talk about the updates from a marketing and brand perspective.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #800000;">Focus on Photos</span></h4>
<p>If we've said it once, we've said it a dozen times, integrate photo sharing into your content mix. Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and the sheer magnitude of Instagram's success should have been enough to convince you to start sharing photos on your social media. But Google+ has taken photo sharing to another dimension with the latest updates.</p>
Here's the gist of the photo editing features:
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Auto-Awesome automatically adjusts photos and groups them together. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Auto-Awesome Motion takes multiple photos and turns them into an animated image. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Users can edit and add effects to photos directly inside Google+, no need to use another application. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">They managed to cut out the middle man (in this sense Instagram and Vine)and integrated photo editing directly into their network. Well played guys. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">In an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/google-focuses-photos-fight-twitter-facebook-instagram/story?id=19194398#.UZYd9ytgbbA" title="ABC news interview" target="_self">ABC news interview</a>, Gundotra said "Our goals are to make people happy and get technology out of the way. You know what makes people happy? Great photos of the people they care about. Today the steps involved to get people happy is very complicated. Take a photo, remember to get it off the device, get it on to the machine, edit it, back it up, share it." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Gundotra couldn't be more right. Photo editing and sharing on social media is overly complicated, but remains a task that users willingly complete day after day. Google+ offers an alternative approach to this social media phenomenon and critics could not wait to point out the kink in Google+'s armor - the network's not putting social <strong>first. </strong>While that statement seems true on it's face, Google has so much data on its users that social can actually stand to be second. Take into account the amount of activity and usage throughout Google product line. They already have the numbers. The plan is to move the numbers across products to the 'social spine' seamlessly. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 13px; color: #800000;">New Layout = Better Storytelling  </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Google+ has gone the way of Pinterest, Facebook, and Mashable when it comes to looks. The side-by-side column layout is obviously still trending and we must say it looks good ya Google. But with the 2-column layout comes the need to properly balance the content mix so one content type is not dominating your profile. Your posts tell your brand story and now that they are arranged side by side, you need to be more intentional about what you post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">From photos to video and text posts, find a rhythm to your storytelling. Balance your feed. </span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #800000;">Related Hashtags</span></h4>
Watch out Twitter. The redesigned Google+ newsfeed automatically generates hashtags related to posts in an effort to encourage exploration. When you click on the hashtag, the post flips to show you other content with that same hashtag. The fact that the hashtags generate automatically is a definite plus, because that means the content will be relevant across the board. Unlike hashtags on Instagram and Twitter which are user generated and most times send you down a rabbit hole. This is a great way to discover new people who are posting about the same things as you. Finding new people to follow has always been my number one complaint with Google+. Well, that and the lack of vanity urls. 
<h4><span style="color: #800000;">Hangouts Integration</span></h4>
Now that Google+ Hangouts are the company's unified messaging service, Google aims to make Google+ the central communications hub. Hangouts replaced chat and now it's more prominently positioned on the right side. You can even share photos, emoticons and everything else you could in chat. <br>Google annouced more than just upgrades to Google+ at their conference in San Francisco. Stay tuned for more information about what else you have to look forward to this year. Until next time, join us on Google+!

      <title>Part 2: The Content Marketing Roadmap for Busy Inbound Marketers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Today, we’re continuing on to Part Two of <em>The Content Marketing Roadmap for Busy Inbound Marketers. </em>Part One covered the <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Plan</b></span> and <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Audience</b></span> stages of the Content Marketing Institute’s Content Marketing Framework – 7 Building Blocks to Success. </p>
<p>Let’s jump right back into this discussion. Today, we will cover the <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Story</b></span> and <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Channel</b></span> stages of the content marketing process. In an effort to round out things out a bit, we are reaching beyond CMI’s perspective on storytelling.</p>
<p>Ok, so by now it should be clear that content marketing is about much more than selling something and storytelling is no different. In fact, it’s the foundation of all your content developments. Masters of storytelling succeed in developing strong customer relationships over time. The key words being ‘over time’ because the story should be continuous and never ending. </p>
<h2><span style="color: #800000;">3. Story</span></h2>
<p>The hard part for most marketers is deciding what should be part of the company or client's story, both long and short term. Remember, in this context, the word ‘story’ does not correlate to an actual beginning, middle, and end type of tale. Story refers to the art of clearly and concisely delivering your message with both passion and purpose.   </p>
<p>Here are the basic points to cover:</p>
<p>-       How did your company get its start?</p>
<p>-       How did you come to this point?</p>
<p>-       What fuels your current and future successes?</p>
<p>-       What is your unique value proposition? </p>
<p>-       What do you offer and why is it unique?</p>
<p>Other than that, there are no ‘rules’ to narrative development in storytelling. There is no linear path to follow, but CMI suggests using the <em>Brand Hero’s Journey Chart</em> to uncover your company or client’s ‘story.’ It helps you develop a structure to use for one content marketing initiative or an entire content marketing plan.<img id="img-1368447476711" src="/Portals/123780/images/CMI%20Brand%20Hero's%20Journey%20-%20Inbound%20Marketing%20Internet%20Marketing-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="CMI Brand Hero%27s Journey   Inbound Marketing Internet Marketing resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></p>
<p>As far as what type of content you choose to create and publish, we have a few ideas for content topics listed below:</p>
<p>-       Brand Perspectives, Resources</p>
<p>-       Customer Thoughts</p>
<p>-       In the News and Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>-       Influencer Point of Views</p>
<p>-       Customer Profiles</p>
<p>-       Internal and External Thought Leadership Perspectives</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">7 Tried and True Content Types:</span></h3>
<p>-       E-Books</p>
<p>-       Blogs</p>
<p>-       Infographics</p>
<p>-       User Content</p>
<p>-       Websites</p>
<p>-       Email</p>
<p>-       Video</p>
<p>Find a method and rhythm that works for your company or client, test, measure, and adjust accordingly. </p>
<h2><span style="color: #800000;">4. Channels</span></h2>
<p>Once you’ve developed your story, it’s time to share your story with the world. Finding the <em>right</em> channels to deliver your message is necessary to ANY successful content marketing program.</p>
<p>One thing CMI stresses is that ‘how’ and ‘where’ your audience receives your message is just as important as the message itself. Why you ask? Because every platform is unique and so are the audiences on those platforms. The LinkedIn crowd is very different from those found on Reddit. Placing the wrong message in the wrong channel hurt your cause, so tailor your message to the medium. </p>
<p>Another thing, your channels should not exist in a vacuum. Channels are determined based on your content strategy. If your strategy calls for targeting 13 - 24 year olds, then Vine is a good choice and don't invest in building out your LinkedIn presence.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">4 Tips to Guide Channel Strategy:</span></h3>
<p>-       Develop a plan to identify all the current and future channels</p>
<p>-       Determine objectives for each channel and how they integrate with one another</p>
<p>-       Construct an editorial plan to organize when and where you will publish content</p>
<p>-       Format a budget for any design work or other expenses related to your communication channels</p>
<p>After you have your channel plan set, do not make the mistake of committing to it. Channels come and go all the time. Remember when MySpace was all the rage? Depending on when you were born, you may or may not have been part of the MySpace era. Sadly, it is no longer a viable channel unless you are in the music industry. Even then, there are several other musician channels on the market and more on the horizon. Long story short, don't get comfortable. Monitor industry trends, continue assessing the effectiveness of your channels with your marketing team. Test, measure, and adjust accordingly. </p>
<p>This concludes our discussion on <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Story</strong></span> and <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Channels</strong></span>, but check back tomorrow as the <em>Content Marketing Roadmap for Busy Inbound Marketers</em> moves on to <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Process</strong></span> and<span style="color: #800000;"><strong> Conversations</strong></span>.</p>

      <title>The Content Marketing Roadmap for Busy Inbound Marketers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<span style="font-size: 13px;">Being a marketer in the 21st century is a lot more complex than it was years ago. </span><br><p>The endless jugging act of creating original content for multi-tiered marketing campaigns, following up on leads, staying on top of the latest industry trends, all while continuing to grow your own business and brand is the new normal for even the most traditional of marketers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, your (or inability) to adapt to the ever changing nature of this field ultimately determines your success and longevity in this business. </p>
<p>Unless you've been living under a rock for the past few years, you already know that content marketing is a necessity for your marketing plan, as well as your clients. What you probably don't know is how to shift gears and get on the content marketing train. It is hard to find your way, but it's not impossible. You just need to visualize yourself completing the goal and commit to a strategy. In this blog, we will identify a very simple roadmap to help busy inbound marketers get on the path to content marketing bliss.</p>
<p><a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com" title="The Content Marketing Institute" target="_self">The Content Marketing Institute</a> has done a great job of simplifying this process, so we'll use their methodology to guide our way (see below). You can apply this roadmap to both your marketing company, as well as the clients you serve.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/CMI%20content%20marketing-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="CMI content marketing resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">*The CMI Content Marketing Framework - 7 Building Blocks to Success*</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-size: 1em;"><strong style="font-size: 1em;"><span style="color: #800000;">1. Plan </span></strong></strong></blockquote>
<p>As with all marketing processes, planning is the first step. Where your planning starts depends on where you are in what CMI likes to call 'the content marketing journey.' Regardless of where you find yourself, some things are applicable across the board, such as the outcomes for this stage. You need to answer a few basic questions, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who are you or who is your client? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you/they want to accomplish?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the distinguishing factors between your/their product and service offerings?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are your/their strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities both internally and externally?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will content marketing plans affect and integrate with existing campaigns? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What and who will the content marketing program involve? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the key deliverables and timetables involved with this project?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are merely the starting point for discussions about your content marketing plan. The answers to these questions will leave you with a better understanding of who you and your clients are, where your marketing currently stands, and where you/they need and want to be in order to achieve and maintain relevant marketing. The overall breadth of your content marketing should continually asses and affirm the company's brand identity.  </p>
<p>This is a solid start on the roadmap to content marketing success. Let's keep moving. The next step is the audience. </p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>2. Audience</strong></span></h3>
<p>The whole point of creating, curating, and publishing content is to reach your targeted audiences. During this stage of the content marketing roadmap, you must determine WHO you want to reach. There are two constant audiences that must be engaged at all times: internal stakeholders (such as employees) and external stakeholders (such as potential leads and current customers). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a survey for the CEO, CMO, and sales and marketing teams. If you're working on your own content marketing, create a survey for yourself and others in your company. Get everyone to all answer these same questions. The survey should ask about the company itself, best practices, competitors, products, services, etc. The goal is to get different perspectives about the company, because everyone of the roles mentioned above may see things in a different way. </p>

It's important to understand as much as possible about the customers you are targeting and engaging. The best way to develop targeted content is to base your content on customer personas. The goal is create a picture(s) of your customer base to guide your communications strategies and tactics. So, when you create a piece of content for a new campaign, the customer you're targeting has some distinguishing characteristics and even a name like "Frugal Freddy" or "Curious Claudia." This way, you're personalizing your content for the intended audience. </p>

      <title>How to Convince Your Boss That Inbound Marketing Is Worth It</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The famous saying "out with the old, in with the new" comes to mind whenever I see companies shifting away from outbound marketing to inbound marketing. </p>
<p>When a company decides to change the foundation of their marketing strategy, it's a pretty big deal, and as is any degree of major organizational change, it does not happen overnight. How then is it that some companies still cling to the empty promises of outbound marketing? Either they are seeing a significant return on investment or they are in serious denial about the evolution that marketing has undergone in the last 10 years.  </p>
<p>No doubt it must be difficult for marketers working in organizations that refuse to acknowledge or accept that inbound marketing bears more fruits than outbound. This blog was written especially for this group of marketing professionals to help them make the case for inbound marketing. In this blog, we will take an in-depth look at the pros vs. cons and discuss examples of both marketing strategies to determine which is the best bang for your company's marketing buck. Keep in mind that a marketing strategy is not a one size fits all situation. If you are in an industry that could generate or is currently generating customers through the Internet, you should continue reading this blog. </p>
<p><b>Outbound &amp; Inbound Marketing Defined</b></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.leadformix.com/blog/2012/10/is-outbound-marketing-still-important-for-demand-generation/" title="Outbound Marketing" target="_self">Outbound Marketing</a></em>, also referred to as 'interrupt' marketing, is essentially any form of activity that 'pushes' content to consumers. Think TV advertisements, cold-calling, direct mail, subscribing people to email lists, banner ads, radio, etc. It is the type of marketing that customers reject as intrusive and unwanted. This old or traditional way of reach consumers is referred to by marketers some as an age-old demand generation tool. </p>
<p><em>Inbound Marketing </em>is a marketing strategy that focuses on getting found online by customers. The evolution of consumer behavior caused this shift in marketing strategy. Savvy companies are making changes to their marketing budgets to account for this shift and reach consumers that cannot be reached using traditional methods. </p>
<p><b><span style="color: #800000;">Why Can't Consumers Be Reached by Traditional Marketing?</span></b></p>
<p>We are not saying no consumer can be reached with outbound marketing. Anyone who tells you such a thing is simply not being truthful. There is still a purpose and place for outbound marketing in nearly every companies marketing mix. However, the path that today's consumer takes to discover a product is vastly different now that the Internet is so robust. Here are some stats to help you understand why consumers are not as receptive to traditional marketing as they once were:</p>
<ul>
<li>86% of people skip television advertisements</li>
<li>44% of direct mail goes in the trash unopened</li>
<li>84% of 25-to-34 year olds left a favorite website due to intrusive or irrelevant ads</li>
<li>91% of email users have unsubscribed from a company email after initially opting in</li>
</ul>
<p>These facts should not be a complete surprise to you because we are all consumers and understand the annoyance of outbound marketing. So why continue to put so many eggs in that basket? It is time to reevaluate your marketing budget. Still not convinced? Let's talk ROI.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Get More Out of Your Budget</b></span></p>
<p>Yes, another buzzword that helps every boss is obsessed with. If you need to add more fuel to the fire before your boss will get on the inbound marketing bandwagon, this next point should drive your message home.</p>
<p>Inbound marketing costs 62% LESS than outbound. In fact, 3 out of 4 inbound marketing channels costs less than ANY outbound channel. </p>
<p>Inbound boosts customer acquisition through company blogs, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Synergy is Essential</b></span></p>
<p>As we said before, no one is advocating for you to completely abandon outbound marketing in favor of inbound. Instead, find a synergy between the two strategies to reach customers offline and online. While the 25-34 demographic is receptive to inbound, the older demographic still appreciates receiving things in the mail and being able to talk with someone on the phone. They may or may not engage in your Facebook contest or read your blog, but you can be they are listening to the radio and attending tradeshows.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Tips for Create Synergy While Shifting Your Budget to Inbound</b></span></p>
<p>Even though we have provided sufficient justification for transitioning to inbound, do not expect your boss to buy in over night.</p>
<p>Here are 3 tips to help you grease the wheels to transition your company’s traditional marketing strategy to reach the digital consumer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Ruthlessly Measure ROI of Outbound Marketing</strong></span> – Like we said before, bosses love to know about the return of activities that cost. It is no secret that outbound marketing such as television and radio ads, banner ads, and the like cost big bucks. For each campaign, set success goals, develop cost/benefit analysis and determine if the return on investment was worth it.</li>
<li>
<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #800000;"><strong>Create Campaigns With Inbound Aspects</strong></span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> – If your company takes out a full page ad in a print magazine each quarter like clockwork, make a case for the campaign to feature key messages and QR code that features a leads consumers to a cool video instead of a webpage pushing consumers to ‘buy buy buy.’ This way, you keep the outbound aspect (print ad), but add an inbound element that can spice it up.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-size: 13px; color: #800000;"><strong>Keep Track of the Competitions Inbound Efforts</strong></span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> – Nothing will get your bosses attention faster than saying ‘we’re behind our peers on this.’ They hate being late to the party, but how will they know they are late if you fail to put that bug in their ear?</span>
</li>
</ol>

      <title>5 Inbound Marketing Metrics Every Marketer Should Be Obsessed With</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>If you find yourself wondering what inbound marketing metrics you SHOULD BE measuring, you are not alone. Marketers are commonly asked to provide analytics feedback to their bosses to determine the overall effectiveness of their marketing efforts. </p>
<p><img id="img-1366133932679" src="/Portals/123780/images/inbound-marketing-lead-generation-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="inbound marketing lead generation resized 600" width="328" height="246" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>There are plenty of inbound marketing analytics products on the market, but which will give you the right metrics? The other question is what data do you need to make your case? Every marketing goal or objective requires measuring for a different metric. </p>
<p>In this blog, we will discuss the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">5 inbound marketing metrics that every marketer should become obsessed with.</span> </p>
<p>These metrics should be measuring these metrics on a daily basis. That is right, I said daily basis, not monthly or weekly. The whole point of investing money, time, and resources into building out your website with content and offers is to reach customers and keep them engaged until they are purchasing your services or products. Without an strong grasp of how customers interact with your website and offers, you are in the dark about your overall effectiveness. </p>
<p><b>5 Inbound Marketing Metrics to Measure DAILY</b></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #800000;">Website Visitors</span></strong> - Anyone who finds you online organically or via paid ads falls into the general website visitor category. Search engines index websites based on how heavy they are, so if you update your content regularly and people like what you post to your website, search engines will love your site. Google Analytics is a free tool that can tell you when new or returning visitors enter your site, where that pages they visited, what site they came from, and how long they stayed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #800000;"><img id="img-1366133845657" src="/Portals/123780/images/2-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="customers" width="310" height="279" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;">Customers</span></strong> - A customer is anyone who purchases your products or services. If you are not already tracking their behavior on your website, you are in serious trouble. These are your loyal clients, the people who you should know the most about. Google Analytics will not tell you how many of your customers are using your website, but you could make educated guesses based on how many web visits you received after sending an email to your customers. If you see a spike in traffic, you probably would not be too off base to assume it came from your customers. If you are using an email client like MailChimp, which integrates with Google Analytics, you will be able to track these click-throughs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leads</span></strong></span> - Anyone who shows <em>interest</em> in your products or services online is a lead. By interest, I mean someone who signs up for your email newsletter, request a demo, sign up for a webinar, or download an e-book on a landing page. Leads are potential customers who have yet to actually purchase something from you. But they have shown an interest in what you offer. It makes sense to track these folks, right?</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conversion Rates</span></strong></span> - The rate at which a web visitor or customer goes beyond the casual web visit or e-book download as a result of a marketing campaign, whether direct or indirect. Here's the formula for measuring conversion rates: </p>
<p> <em>    Conversion rate = Number of goal achievements / visits</em></p>
<p>Every offer you put on your website should have a conversion goal tied to it. Driving people to your website is only the first hump, you need them to become customers. How do you do that? There are more ways to list than we have time for in this blog, but the primary ways are by offering compelling and valuable content followed by crystal clear call to actions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Channel Level Funnel</span></strong> </span>- The funnel is a <img id="img-1366133523717" src="/Portals/123780/images/lead_conversion-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="lead conversion resized 600" width="322" height="182" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">metaphor for the path a customer takes to navigate through the advertising/organic search path created by marketers to eventually make a sale (end of the line). Which channels are bringing customers to your website? Social media, blogs, email marketing, paid ads, or organic search traffic? Once you have identified your key channels, start tracking the 4 things mentioned above to determine what can be changed to improve conversion rates.</p>
<p>Inbound marketing is all about helping potential customers find your website and giving them valuable content with the expectation that they will one day become customers. Tracking and monitoring users on your site is one of, if not the most critical activity marketers should be obsessed with.</p>
<p>Are you tracking your web visitors the right way or are you just reviewing Google Analytics without a true understanding of how to optimize the web experience to reach your marketing goals?</p>
<p>If not, you are far from reaching your full potential. Be on the lookout for our next few blogs, which will be focused on dissecting inbound marketing from every angle possible.

      <title>Using Cover Art CTA To Push Leads from Facebook to Your Website</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Let's say your business is fortunate enough to have a pretty sizable base of engaged Facebook fans. They love to 'Like' and leave positive and sometimes snarky comments on your posts. You should feel proud of how far you've come and it is safe to say the hardest part of Facebook content creation is over. </p>
<p>Up until now it's been all fun and games, but the time has come to take the gloves off and begin driving people to your business website where the true lead conversion happens. The true test of whether you are any good at this inbound Internet marketing thing is being able to close the loop. Make the sale. Which sounds way too salesly for me, but that is what we're here for. <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing" title="Social media marketing" target="_self">Social media marketing</a>, Facebook marketing <span>specifically,</span> makes the sales process less so by giving marketers a way to lighten the mood, give some freebies, and have two-way communication with the consumer. </p>
<p>Which is now a little easier since the running champ of social media, Facebook, now allows Fan Pages to use direct call-to-actions on cover art. Prior to last month, Fan Pages had a long list of no-nos about cover art including price information and direct CTA's. Facebook Page Terms currently state the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><img id="img-1365271824179" src="/Portals/123780/images/facebook%20marketing%20with%20cover%20art%20terms-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="facebook marketing with cover art terms resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br></span>
<p>Notice there is nothing in that statement prohibiting CTA's in cover art. Let's discuss a few steps to drive people to your website by using CTA'S in your Facebook cover art.  </p>
<p><img id="img-1365272295207" src="/Portals/123780/images/facebook%20marketing%20advertising%20guidelines-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="facebook marketing advertising guidelines resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">1) Decide On Your Offer </span></h3>
<p>The cover art portion of the Facebook page is prime real estate, so choose wisely. It is the very first thing visitors see when they come to your page, so it can easily turn them off or on. An offensive image or boring offer could result in an 'unlike' and you've lost that person forever. Getting someone to 'relike' your page is more difficult than getting the initial interaction, so don't push it. Offer something valuable to people whether that be a contest or a no-strings freebie. Maybe you don't have merchandise, but can give a free subscription or consultation. </p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">2) Use Tracking Code</span></h3>
<p>Analytics tools like bit.ly are great, because they allow you to create shorter urls with embedded tracking. With a simple copy and paste, you can create a custom url and watch real-time click-throughs from anywhere. One way to see how effective your cover art is in compelling visitors to act is to leave a bit.ly link that leads to your website where the promised offer lies. In the example below, Hubspot attempted this very thing and received praises and criticism from their fans. Anyone who clicked on it was tracked back to Hubspot's website where they either signed up for the ebook or floated to another page on the site. Either way, Hubspot was able to see how many people converted, where they went after. </p>

<h3><span style="color: #800000;">3) Create Cover Art and Landing Page</span></h3>
<p>Now that you know what you want to offer and have code to track it with, it is time to design the cover art. Make sure your cover art is visually reflective of your overall brand. Also, design a custom landing page that ties in with your cover art. Keep the look and feel cohesive, as well as the text. You've got to ease people into your website, so dedicate this entire page to a simple download form and the same graphics from your cover art. Use Google analytics, or whatever product you use, to track the visitor flow to see where people went once they landed on your page. </p>
<p>Now that you have everything in place, the last step is to upload the cover art and make the landing page live. Leave it for a week to see if anyone likes or comments. If they don't take to your first one, come up with something different next week. Run a contest to get people to sign up for your blog or giveaway an iPad for a certain number of likes. Whatever you offer, do not forget to use tracking code, create custom cover art and landing pages each time.</p>

      <title>The Fast Track to Google Plus Local Optimization</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p class="p1">As a business owner, you already know the value of having a web presence of some type. Whether it is a fancy website with all the bells and whistles or a Facebook page, chances are you have taken some steps to get your business listed on the Internet. But how visible is your business online compared to your competitors? Are you outshining the competition or barely able to compete? </p>
<p class="p1">An excellent marketing tool that you should have heard about by now are Google Plus Local pages, formerly known as Google Places. Google Plus Local optimization is a perfect marriage of search and social media in one integrated platform. It is a powerful new way for local businesses to amplify their messages to reach consumers shopping on the Internet. Because it is powered by Google, Local pages are able to be optimized for local search engine optimization that could do more for your business than your stagnant website ever could. If you do not have the money or time to invest in building out your website the right way, I suggest you look into Google+ Local pages as a solution.</p>
<p class="p1">In this blog, you will learn what Google+ Local pages are and a few tips on how to optimize them for local SEO.</p>
<p class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>What are Google+ Local Pages?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Google+ Local pages are business profile pages that replaced Google Places Pages last year. Once completed 100%, a Google+ Local page can provide your potential and current customer base with everything they need to know about your business, as well as honest reviews from other customers. </p>
<p class="p3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>What's In It for Business Owners?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Besides the obvious value of empowering your customer base with information to make a purchase, Google+ Local pages can be a great tool for keeping people up to date on any changes related to your business. Not only that, Google+ Local pages help you index in Google organically which is completely free of charge! Exciting stuff, right?  </p>
<p class="p1">The trick to taking full advantage of this wonderfully FREE opportunity is to provide accurate information on your business page. Of course, you need the basic information such as business address, phone number, business type and hours, etc. Unlike Google Places, Google+ Local brings social media to the mix, which has spiced things up a bit, for better or worse. If you are doing a great job, you can bet customers are leaving amazing reviews about your products and services. If you are doing a piss poor job, folks will leave review to that effect. This feature is very reminiscent of Yelp, but it offers the indexing benefit which will allow more people searching keywords related to your business to find the good, bad, and ugly about your products and services. The key to remember is that you have the power in this situation. You are ultimately in control of your products and services, and once claimed, you have the ability to respond to any negative reviews, as well as positive ones. </p>
<p class="p1">The only way to unlock the power of your Google+ Local page is first <a href="http://https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1713911?hl=en" title="CLAIM YOUR PAGE." target="_self">CLAIM YOUR PAGE.</a> It is a simple and straightforward claim process, so take note of the tips listed below. </p>
<p class="p3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>A Few Tips on Optimizing Google+ Local Pages for Local SEO</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Tip #1 - Claim Your Google+ Local Page</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Go to Google.com. Type your business name into the search box. If you have a Google+ Page, it will show up in the top few search results with a location marker symbol (see picture). If you do not have a page, you should create one. </p>
<p class="p1">When you visit your page, there will be a 'manage this page' button on the far right side. Click it. Then follow the steps. </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Tip #2 - Complete Your Profile 100%</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Take the time now to completely fill out every field on your profile. Google will index this information in their search engine making it easy as cake for customers to find your information. If you have multiple locations, take the time to fill out the profile completely for all locations. Be sure to use your business-related keywords because it will help you rank higher in Google search. Do not stuff keywords though. Doing so will cause Google to slap your hand. Add photos of your business location, products, services, logo, etc. Give people the proper stimulation to make them want to do business with you.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Tip #3 - Get Listed in Directories</b></span></p>
<img id="img-1364316775195" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-26%20at%2012.39.18%20PM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Boosting search engine optimization through directories" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;"><div>
<p class="p1">Yes, this will require completing many more profiles, but in the end it is worth it. Directories drive traffic and give you more exposure. Verify that your information is absolutely correct in these places before publishing, because people rarely remember to come back and update these. At the very least, list your business website url. Here's a list of local and niche directories from an Entrepreneur.com article (<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217982-2#"><span class="s1">http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217982-2#</span></a>) :</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Tip #4 - Start Making Posts to Your Google+ Page</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Now that you are set up on Google and have left some breadcrumbs to lead customers to your page, start making social media-like posts to keep them engaged. What type of posts you ask? Make it fun and simple. Post coupons. Use pictures and video. Not only text. That will get old after a while and will not stimulate engagement in the least.  </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Tip #5 - Promote Your Google+ Local Page in Your Establishment</b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Tell the people you do business with everyday, as well as your employees, that you created or claimed your page. Once they know, they will want to share their positive (or negative) experiences with the masses. The key is to start small and gradually build up. Do not expect your page to completely replace your website or other social media accounts. It will, however, be a great way for new and current customers to get directions to your business faster, find out new info, and allow them to see what others think. </p>
<p class="p1">If reading this blog opened up a whole can of worms related to your business' online presence and you want to talk it over with us, we are here to help you assess the situation. If you Googled your business name and found out there is already a page with terrible reviews and you need advice on how to make things right, again, we are here to help you. There is no need to navigate this situation alone and possibly make situations worse. Remember, when it comes to the Internet, the world is watching so put your best foot forward.</p>

      <title>Why Local Restaurants Should Invest in Internet Marketing</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<img id="img-1363532926381" src="/Portals/123780/images/austin_local_food_restaurants-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="austin local food restaurants resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><p>As a resident of Atlanta and self-proclaimed foodie, I have encountered the best and worst of both worlds when it comes to the digital presence of local restaurants. I am consistently disappointed with the way so many restaurants fail to properly use <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/" title="Internet marketing" target="_self">Internet marketing</a>. There are many great experiences, and I am grateful for them.</p>
<p>However, it seems the majority of my favorite eateries are either too busy or just do not care. Even though I continue to dine at these places, I cringe when I try to Google search a menu using the official name or <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="basic keywords/phrases" target="_self">basic keywords/phrases</a> and get nothing in return. Or worse, they have an inaccurate or dated web presence and lifeless social media, which is actually worse than having none at all. This persisting annoyance inspired today's blog. </p>
<p>In this blog I have set out explain to restaurant owners why they should invest in Internet marketing and how they can get started or clean up their act. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Lack of Marketing Causes Restaurant Failures </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b></b></span>FACT: <a href="http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/Ec1F07/restaurantsfail.pdf">Research</a> shows that restaurant failures can be studied from economic, marketing, and managerial perspectives. ("Why Restaurants Fail" by H. G. Parsa, John T. Self, David Njite, and Tiffany King)</p>
<p>For the purposes of this blog, we are only focusing on the marketing perspective. Below I identified four marketing tools that are critical to a restaurant's success. Word of mouth is not enough. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Website</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review sites and directories (Google places, Yelp, Bing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media (Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online deals/coupons (Groupon, Scout Mob, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Making your restaurant easy to find online by providing basic information in the above-mentioned forms is what your customers expect. People search online using their cell phones and desktops to decide on places to have their next meal. So who you are, what you offer and what makes you different from others restaurants should be easy to find. Not only that, customers want to know when are you open and when you host special events, promos, etc., where can they connect with you on the sites they frequent most like <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing" title="Facebook" target="_self">Facebook</a>, Twitter, Google, Bing, Foursquare, etc. </p>
<p>Because customers are searching online for lunch and dinner ideas. not to mention, the guy down the street does. Chances are that your competition already has a website and a marketing plan to gain and keep clients. If you are drawing a blank about what information you should put on your website, see the list below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The basics - location/address, hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The food - menu with <b>updated</b> prices, details about ingredients (people need to know what is in it. For example, gluten-free, no msg, etc. It shows people you care about their healthy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show and tell - photos and videos of food, interior, happy customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third party approval - reviews from Google, Twitter, Facebook, video testimonials. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This stuff is not rocket science or brain surgery. I frequent a lot of places that have top-notch service and food, but put no effort into extending their brand to the digital landscape. I cannot figure out why. Other than not having the money or manpower to create and manage these sites. I am always tempted to reach out to restaurant owners and ask why they have let this very simple, yet essential part of their marketing fall by the wayside. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Why Should Restaurant Owners Invest in an Internet Marketing Campaign?</b> </span></p>
<p>Because customers are searching online for lunch and dinner ideas. Not to mention, the guy down the street is doing it. Chances are your competition already has a website and a marketing plan to gain and keep clients. Take a look at the amount of Google searches that have happened over time for various restaurants. </p>
<p><b>Google trends</b> - interest over time for Italian, Mexican, Chinese, food trucks in Atlanta, 2010 – 2013</p>
<p><img id="img-1363532712957" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-17%20at%2010.53.03%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Google Trends Data for Restraurnat" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>If you are a local restaurant owner without a website or a Google places account, you could be earning a lot more revenue if you invested in an Internet marketing campaign. Download our free ebook below to get started.</p>

      <title>The Pros and Cons of Facebook's Redesigned Newsfeed</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p class="p1">They've done it again. Facebook announced yet major another update last Thursday - a redesigned newsfeed. Although the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/07/facebook-launches-multiple-topic-based-feeds-bigger-images-and-a-consistent-design-across-devices/" title="Facebook newsfeed" target="_self">Facebook newsfeed</a> hasn't been redesigned in a number of years, it seems like they're making changes to the user interface every week.</p>
<p class="p1"><img id="img-1363028216170" src="/Portals/123780/images/new-feed-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="facebook social media marketing news feed" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1">While it's easy to become annoyed with the endless onslaught of tweaks, you've got to applaud their commitment to their mission - making the world more open. Their mission isn't flawed or evil per say, it's their failure to properly communicate their changes and motives that gets under people's skin. Ah well. We can only grit our teeth, adapt to the latest change and hope it's mutually beneficial for users and advertisers. Both audiences are the lifeblood of Facebook and we understand that it's a tough juggling act. </p>
<p class="p1">Another one of Facebook's goals is to become the "best personalized newspaper." The redesigned newsfeed brings them one step closer to that goal by bringing larger images and content-specific newsfeed streams. Now you can press a button and the newsfeed will reconfigure to only display photos, music, games, liked pages, and more. There are clear pros for the everyday user and obvious cons for advertisers. </p>
<p class="p1">In this blog, we'll give you the run down on exactly what changed, why, and what's in it for both audiences. For advertisers there are a  few (very few) opportunities to exploit, but there are more benefits for the average user. </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What's Changed and Why?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><b><img id="img-1363028199115" src="/Portals/123780/images/photos-feed-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="facebook social media marketing feeds" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br></b></span></p>
<p class="p1">Facebook wants you to spend more time on their website. Instead of trying to fight your way through a single stream of updates from everyone you're connected with, Facebook has neatly organized the content by categories. Now you don't have to see everything at once. Instead you can toggle back and forth between music, games, photos, friends, and following feeds. So, instead of fumbling around on your own, Facebook is giving you direct options to choose from. Rather than scrolling to the bottom of your newsfeed and eventually leaving the site, Facebook has provided clear options to increase the time you spend on their 'digital newspaper.' Here are the content steams:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<p>All Friends Feed - get an intimate look at what your friends are sharing</p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p>Following - updates from brand pages, news media outlets, and celebrities, etc.</p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p>Photos - bigger photos with an Instagram-like feel </p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p>Music - find newly released albums, music your friends have liked</p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p>Games </p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p>Interest Lists or Friends Lists  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The web view will mirror the mobile view, so users will have a consistent experience.  </p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><b>User Benefits</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The power to choose what they see</span> - the biggest benefit for users is the ability to control which content they see through the content-specific feeds. If a user never wants to interact with a page they've liked, they simply need never go to the 'following' feed. </p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Less clutter</span> - sites like Twitter and Instagram have experienced success with cleaner interfaces. It logically follows that Facebook would the same for its users.  </p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Optimized by preference</span> - the feeds are automatically sorted by which one you check the most. They're tailored to each users content behavior.</p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Easier to discover other conten</span>t - in addition to organizing its content better, Facebook is also trying to improve the visibility of trending content such as recent articles. You've probably noticed more 'articles' being read by your friends on your newsfeed. With the redesigned newsfeed, it'll be easier to find new content about topics and sources you already 'liked.' </p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Richer content from Instagram and Pinterest</span> - Users with synced accounts will notice their posts are more like what they see on Instagram and Pinterest. Posts from both sites are more vivid and larger. You'll even be able to see your friends face on the side of a post that you both 'like.'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Facebook Marketing Benefits</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bigger photos and ads</span> - when you promote a post that features a photo, that photo will be appear much larger than it ever has before. </p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Following feed</span> - pages may (or may not) see an increase in engagement and likes now that they live on a single feed.</p>
</li>
<li class="li1">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longer link blurbs</span> - the brief summary you can add and edit when posting a link will be longer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Tips for Adjusting to the Change</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Get to know the interface beforehand. How? Take the tour! Don't skip this part as many people often do. </p>
<p class="p1">As usual, Facebook will roll out this update slowly over time in order to get feedback and make changes as they go. </p>
<p class="p1">Here's what Zuck has to say about it all:</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>At a personal level we built a service that lets you see and feel the people and friends you care about. What we’re trying to do is give everyone in the world the best personalized newspaper. It should have quality public content from friends. It should have a front page and it should let you drill down into any topic you want. It should be visual, rich and engaging. It should be displayed with more than just text. From the beginning our goal with news feed was different than what any service was trying to provide. You should be able to share any type of content you want…and with any audience you want. The types you tell with photos are totally different.</em></p>
<p><em>Now that we all have cameras in our pockets, news feed has become primarily about visual content. Almost 50 percent of content in the news feed is visual. Now the average news feed Pages posts are almost 30 percent of the content. How we’re sharing is changing. We all want to share with friends, but want updates from publications we care about, and artists, and world leaders.</em></p>
</blockquote>

      <title>How to Become Your Own In-House Graphic Designer</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"><img id="img-1362500563075" src="/Portals/123780/images/how%20to%20become%20your%20own%20graphic%20designer-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="how to become your own graphic designer resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p class="p1">Owning and operating your own business is hard enough without having to take on the extra task of designing your own print and web graphics. Sadly, this is the position that many business owners find themselves in due to lack of funds and knowledge of a reliable and consistent graphic designer. The result is poorly designed marketing material that do the exact opposite of what you want to accomplish in business. </p>
<p class="p1">I know what you're thinking. "I don't have time to learn graphic design or watch endless training videos on <a href="http://lynda.com" title="Lynda.com" target="_self">Lynda.com</a>." And we hear ya. To truly become an amazing graphic designer, you would need to reenroll in school to pursue a bachelor's degree and no one has time for that. You need amazing print and web graphics that present your business and products in a favorable light with customers. But your half-baked Microsoft Word clip art design will not cut it. In fact, you're doing more harm than good. <strong>(Sidebar: We believe that graphic designers are important and vital professionals. The purpose of this blog is to make SMALL business owners aware of the options that are available to them, because not everyone can afford to have a professional graphic designer. Those who can, should budget for those services because that's the ideal way to go. However, this blog is intended for those who cannot afford it and need short-term solution.)</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Now back to our regular scheduled program...</p>
<p class="p1">It is possible to become your own in-house graphic designer or at the very least substantially cut the cost of hiring a designer for on a project/contractual-basis. We've discovered a wonderful website called <a href="http://envato.com/"><span class="s1">Envato Marketplace</span></a>, which offers reasonable priced (downright cheap) digital and print graphic materials that are fully editable (for the most part) and customizable for your specific needs. </p>
<p class="p1">Whether you're looking for a search engine friendly web site or photoshop design templates, Envato Marketplace has a solution. When it comes to putting your best foot forward, ask yourself two questions. Are your original designs helping or hurting your business? As a potential customer of your own business, do you find your printed and web graphic presence appealing? </p>
<p class="p1">If you answered yes to both questions and are not a trained graphic designer, you are lying to yourself. It's time to wake up and smell the roses. Now that you've got a good whiff, it's time to change the current condition of your graphic presence starting with your printed promotions. </p>
<p class="p1">Of course, you'll need to have at least some introductory knowledge of design software to make use of the available files. Hopefully the Adobe Creative Suite is not a foreign concept to you. If so, take some time to go check out tutorials on Lynda.com for the following graphic design software applications:</p>
<p class="p1"><img id="img-1362500034438" src="/Portals/123780/images/adobe%20photoshop-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="adobe photoshop" width="90" height="90" class="alignLeft"></p>
<img id="img-1362500026291" src="/Portals/123780/images/Adobe_Illustrator-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Adobe Illustrator" width="92" height="90" class="alignLeft" style="float: left; height: 90px; width: 92px;"><div>

<p class="p1"><img id="img-1362500074017" src="/Portals/123780/images/adobe%20indesign.jpeg" border="0" alt="Adobe InDesign" width="92" height="92" class="alignLeft"></p>
<p class="p1">Watch the first few basic videos to understand how to use the toolbars and different features in each of these applications. Also learn how they work together. I know this may not be your cup of tea, but when you consider the cost savings of doing your own graphic design work (at least temporarily) until your startup is, well, started, you'll understand how much knowing the basics really matters. Learning the basics will also make you appreciate your next graphic designer a lot more, because you'll understand why they charge so much for what they do. </p>
<p class="p1">We'll take you through all the individual marketplaces of Envato and explain how you can get started.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sign-Up for an Envato Marketplace account. </b>You only need a single login and password to access every marketplace.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-05%20at%2011.11.58%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Envato Sign Up" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;"></p>

<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><b>Get your print graphics from GraphicRiver. </b></p>
<p class="p1"><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-05%20at%2010.09.20%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Graphicriver print and web graphics" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">This is the place where you can find print templates, graphics, web elements, vectors, icons, fonts, logos, and more. Simply scroll over the headings on the top menu bar to see your options. Look under print templates and you will find templates for things like business cards, stationery, newsletters, cards, brochures, etc. Basically everything you need to create you establish your brand offline. This should go without saying, but find templates that are easily editable and offer your preferred color scheme. </p>
<p class="p1"><b>Next, find your photos in PhotoDune. </b></p>
<p class="p1"><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-05%20at%2010.08.48%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Photodune Stock Photography" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;"></p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">This is where you can find stock photography to fill your printed brochures, posters, flyers, etc. There are lots of stock photography websites on the Internet, so if you prefer using another site, feel free to do so. The beauty of Envato is that it has everything you need under one roof with a single login. So, the more you can centralize your efforts in one spot, the less time you'll waste logging in and out of different sites. Simple is better. </p>
<p class="p1"><b>Lastly, let's pick a website in ThemeForest.</b></p>
<p class="p1"><img id="img-1362499781483" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-05%20at%2010.09.01%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Themeforest Website Themes" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;"></p>
<div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></div>
<p> </p>
<p>In the old days, you needed at least a $700 budget to design a barebones website. Thankfully those days are no more. Today, all you need is a blog and a url to have a presence online. But a regular blog won't represent your brand well. What you need is a theme, whether Wordpress or html, theme's work as a designed 'skin' for your blog. There are loads of options in ThemeForest. Take a look around and find something that works for your brand. Make sure it's search engine optimization friendly. There are a number of video tutorials you can watch to figure out how to set up a website using your new theme. Once you decide to purchase, you'll be able to ask the creator of the theme questions in an online, support forum of some kind. </p>

      <title>Here's a Cool Tool For Performing Competitive Website Analysis</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Have you ever wondered about your competitor’s traffic data? Where it's coming from, and who they are?  I bet you have! On the off chance that this thought ever crossed your mind, we want to share a web tool that gives you a good indication of how your competition is doing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.compete.com/us/pro/features/">Compete</a> is a web tool that helps you “become a better online marketer” by giving you the ability to research competitor web traffic, identify keywords, discover the source of competitor referral traffic, and more.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-16%20at%208.29.33%20AM-resized-600.png" alt="Compete Competitive Analysis" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>Sadly, this is not a free service. Pricing and plan information is available online, but for now, let’s talk more about how you can use the features for your own good. If you are knee deep in a struggle for competitive keywords, it would be nice to rely on something other than Google, Yahoo, and Bing for data.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Competitor Web Demographics</b></span></p>
<p>You don’t need a magic ball to find out the age, income, and gender of your competitors web visitors. Compete will gladly provide you with up to two years of your competitors demographic data. What can you do with this information? Use it to recalibrate your online marketing strategy to gain an advantage over your online competitors.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Incoming Traffic and Engagement Analytics</b></span></p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/sitereferraltool-resized-600.jpeg" alt="site referral tool" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>It’s not enough just to know who is visiting your competitors website, you need to know why they are visiting and more importantly, what your competition is doing to attract them in the first place. Compete claims to offer the ability to “reverse engineer” traffic building strategies from any website. You can even discover referral sites that your competitors use to funnel traffic to their own website. The takeaway for you is clear – update your online marketing strategy to target these sites and leverage strategies that actually <em>work</em>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Benchmarking &amp; Ranking Ability</b></span></p>
<p>Knowing where you stand as it pertains to online marketing metrics is critical to measuring your success, or failure, in reaching any new goals. Simply put, you have to know where you are before you can get where you want to go. You have to know where to focus your efforts and where not to waste time. Compete will tell you what your online market share is in your specific industry. You can even create lists of the top websites ranked by specific metrics within Compete.</p>
<p>If you are exploring options to tilt the odds in your favor, do some more research on Compete. Here’s a <a href="http://www.sugarrae.com/reviews/compete-pro-review/">review</a> from another online marketer.

      <title>How to Drive Social Commerce Using a Twitter Hashtag</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Many companies are still on the fence about the marketing value of using Twitter for business. While some are confused on how twitter works, many just aren’t completely sold on using the micro-blog as legitimate marketing tool. Budgets are tight and besides increased exposure, Twitter’s return on investment for small business was dismal…until now. </p>
<p>Two companies, American Express and Chirpify, are taking Twitter marketing to the next level by allowing users to make purchases online using hashtags. Finally the use of Twitter hashtags is DIRECTLY linked to a monetary gain. In this blog, you will learn how American Express and Chirpify are using Twitter hashtags to drive Twitter-based commerce, or T-Commerce for short. The takeaway is clear – start thinking of ways to use Twitter hashtags to sell your product or merchandise and, of course, get more Twitter followers.</p>
<p>Last year, American Express introduced a new Twitter marketing strategy that offers couponless discounts to cardholders for tweets. The program is simple enough: tweet about the things you love and AmEx will save you money.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>How It Works</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit sync.americanexpress.com/twitter to sync your AmEx card with your Twitter account.</li>
<li>Tweet a hashtag like #amexshoes and savings are instantly loaded to your card. AmEx works with brands like McDonalds, Zappos, Best Buy, and Whole Foods Market to make this tradeoff worth the consumers wild.</li>
</ul>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="315" id="img-1360763052079" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0B-Km9vAIwo" width="560"></iframe>
<p>As of Monday, February 11, AmEx upgraded their <a href="https://sync.americanexpress.com/twitter/(X(1)S(lpjvisnrzo5whbcb15dwdsn0))/Index?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">Sync program</a> to allow cardholders to purchase featured items online using Twitter hashtags. AmEx has managed to completely streamline and simply the purchase process by taking out several steps for their cardholders. Currently there are only a few items available for purchase via Twitter hashtag: an AmEx giftcard, Amazon Kindle HD, Xbox Controller, etc. Not only do cardholders enjoy the convenience of purchasing using Twitter hashtags, they get the items at a discounted rate.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CUXQYrn8zds" width="560"></iframe>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Marketing Takeaway</b></span> – Use social media to reward your customers for the things they love and tweet about already. If you provide a valuable offer to your current customers, they will hold up their end of the bargain and do the marketing for you.</p>
<p>While this is exciting news for AmEx cardholders, it is not necessarily anything new to the social media marketing game. Another company, <a href="https://chirpify.com/">Chirpify,</a> is responsible for making Twitter “transaction friendly” by allowing users to buy AND sell items directly by replying with “buy”. I know what you’re thinking. I already use PayPal for social commerce and payments. Can it get any easier than PayPal? The answer is YES and brands and bands like Taco Bell and Green Day are already using this tool to drive commerce on Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>How it Works Video</b></span></p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/51356204?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400"></iframe>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Getting Started with Chirpify</b></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Set up an account for free</li>
<li>Link your PayPal account to receive payments</li>
<li>Sync your Twitter and Instagram accounts</li>
<li>Create listings</li>
</ol>
<p>For starters, you can create three different types of listings: For Sale, Fundraiser, or Gimmie. The first two are pretty obvious, but the third, Gimmie, allows you to host social giveaways. </p>
<p>While it’s free to signup for Chirpify, they charge 5% per transaction for a basic account. If you choose to upgrade your account to “Enterprise,” a robust offering of features is available to you.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Enterprise Account Features:</b></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Promo/Coupons Codes</li>
<li>Giveaways</li>
<li>Umbrella Accounts</li>
<li>Priority Support</li>
<li>Advanced Reporting</li>
<li>Branded Registration</li>
<li>Branded Storefront</li>
<li>Best Practices Training</li>
<li>Flexible Transaction</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">Promoted Listings</span></li>
</ol>
<p>If that sounds like a sweet deal to you, contact Chirpify to receive a quote for an Enterprise account. We suggest testing the waters for a while with the Basic account to see if your customers catch on to the idea.</p>
<p>It’s clear that this Twitter marketing tool is driving social media commerce in a serious way. Here are some reviews from TechCruch, Media Bistro, and WSJ:</p>

      <title>4 PPC Tips for Valentine's Day 2013</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">It’s that time of year again. Grocery stores are overflowing with heart-shaped candy and stuffed animals while cheesy Hallmark ads seem to dominate every commercial break. All of which is aimed at awakening the hopeless romantic trapped inside us all.</span></p>
<p>The window for Valentine’s Day sales and promotions is officially open. Although February is the shortest month of the year, the season of love, however short, is a big money maker for businesses. That means it is time to whip your <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/ppc-pay-per-click-internet-marketing" title="pay per click ads" target="_self">pay per click ads</a> into shape.</p>
<p>In this blog, we will give you four pay per click strategies for Valentine’s Day 2013. Of course with Valentine’s Day, not every business will be a good fit for themed promotions and sales.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>What Businesses Are Best Suited to Target Valentine’s Day Consumers?</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Restaurants</li>
<li>Gift shops</li>
<li>Florists</li>
<li>Travel agencies</li>
<li>Jewelers</li>
<li>Dating services</li>
<li>Spas</li>
<li>Salons</li>
<li>Bakeries and sweet shops</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? It’s pretty obvious that these businesses offer products that consumers are looking to purchase for their sweethearts. According to a survey by <a href="http://www.orcinternational.com/US/Pages/default.aspx" title="ORC International" target="_self">ORC International</a>, Valentine’s Day is the second most popular gift-giving holiday. It’s a great time for marketers to get their Valentine’s Day offers online for consumers to cash in.<span style="font-size: 13px;"> Here are four tips to can help you get some mileage this season.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>1.    </b><b>Get a Head Start</b></span></p>
<p>Do yourself a favor this year and get ahead of the game. By now (Feb. 6), you should already have decided what sales or promos you plan to offer consumers. If not, sit down and iron that out. Once you have that squared away, launch your campaign swiftly because if last year’s data is any indication of this year, people started searching for Valentine’s Day gift ideas on January 7<sup>th</sup>.  Take a look at the graph below shows that women have a lead on men this year.</p>
<p> </p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;q=gifts+for+him%2Bgifts+for+boyfriend,+gifts+for+her%2Bgifts+for+girlfriend&amp;date=today+1-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=500&amp;h=330"></script><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>2</strong>.    </span><b>Decide on Search Terms</b></span></p>
<p>Here are some of the most searched terms for Valentine’s Day on Google. Bid on them. Use them in your blogs posts to rank in organically in search engines. Again, use them in your pay-per-click ad copy, especially headlines.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;cat=0-18&amp;q=gifts+for+him+%2B+gifts+for+boyfriend,gifts+for+her+%2B+gifts+for+girlfriend&amp;geo=US&amp;date=today+1-m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TOP_QUERIES_0_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=300&amp;h=420"></script><p> </p>
<p>Once you decide on which terms you can afford and what works best for your sales offering, make sure you are placing them properly throughout your marketing copy whether online or in your store. Consistency is important so your efforts do not appear scattered, but rather purposeful and strategic</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>3.    </b><b>Create Specific Landing Pages On Your Website</b></span><span style="font-size: 13px;"> </span></p>
<p>Having individual landing pages for each of your Valentine’s Day promotions is key if you want to convert your web visitors to buying customers. The message you used in your ad copy should mirror what’s on your landing page. It’ll increase your quality score dramatically. Also, make sure to use the most searched terms in our URL, header, ALT tags, etc. so your pages rank.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>4.    </b><b>Evaluate Your Performance &amp; Adjust Your Ads</b></span></p>
<p>Remember, the beauty of online ads is that you have the power to monitor your effectiveness in real-time. You could literally watch click by click and track the subsequent visitors to your website if you so desired. Evaluation is one of the most critical steps in any marketing campaign. When it comes to a tactic such as PPC, continuous monitoring and quick adjustments can be the difference between a successful campaign and a wasted budget.</p>
<p>If the threat of a wasted budget is keeping you up at night, it’s best to hire someone to manage you PPC ads. In the long and short run, you will see a huge return on investment because your current promotions will be successful and you’ll have stronger brand recognition. Make this Valentine's Day a profitable one.</p>

      <title>Twitter's Video App Brings Porn to the App Store</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Apple made no apologies about yanking Vine from the featured section of its App Store after a raunchy porn clip appeared in the ‘editors pick.’</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/26/fly-or-die-vine/">Vine</a>, Twitter’s video-sharing app, experienced a very big porn problem soon after its launch last Thursday. While Twitter is in the process of filtering searches to remove #porn and other similar terms, it’s still unclear if Apple will remove the ban the app altogether.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/130125110109-vine-twitter-app-story-top-resized-600.jpg" alt="Vine " class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>The App Store is pretty strict when it comes to porn and has a zero-tolerance policy on the matter. The app, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/22/apple-pulls-500pxs-mobile-apps-from-the-app-store-claiming-its-too-easy-to-search-for-nude-photos/">500px</a>, was completely removed from the store due to users ability to search for nude pictures. The hallmark of Vine is six-second videos and thousands of users jumped on board merely hours after the app launched. Then came the porn.</p>
<p>According to Twitter, a “human error” is to blame for the uncensored content. Regardless of where the blame lies, Apple has clearly set precedence that it does not tolerate pornography in the App Store. Parents have already begun voicing their concerns about the inability to censor certain material and even worse, child pornography, according to an Apple employee.</p>
<p>"The app [500px] was removed from the App Store for featuring pornographic images and material, a clear violation of our guidelines," said Tom Neumayr said in a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/twitters-vine-includes-pornographic-content/story?id=18336708">statement</a> to ABC News. "We also received customer complaints about possible child pornography. We've asked the developer to put safeguards in place to prevent pornographic images and material in their app."  </p>
<p>500px resubmitted to the App Store after tightening up their filter settings and changing the app’s rating. Twitter is in the process of deleting workaround hashtags, but has made no direct move to restrict users from uploading pornographic material. Instead, they are making it harder for users to find that type of content.</p>
<p>Despite all the controversy, Apple declined to make a statement about whether they would remove Vine from the App Store. It is unlikely that will happen since Apple and Twitter strengthened their relationship through iOS integration. At the moment, Vine is ONLY available through the App Store, so to remove it would be a complete slap in Twitter’s face.</p>
<p>For the time being, Vine is still very active and very much available to the public, including marketers, so let’s get involved! If you had six seconds to share your brand with the world, what would you show? That is the question social media marketers should be asking themselves when it comes to using Vine for business. It’s a very simple app to use, so anyone with an iPhone can join the party.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of how to use Vine from our friends at Mashable.</p>

      <title>Facebook Graph Search: What Social Media Marketers Need to Know</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Facebook’s newly released internal search tool, Graph Search, has received much praise and criticism since emerging on January 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p> <img id="img-1359550815781" src="/Portals/123780/images/Intro.Graph_4-resized-600.jpeg" alt="Facebook Graph Search" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>Despite their critics, it is clear that Facebook is once again taking social media marketing to another level. It’s their official first stab at socializing search to allow users to search through people, photos, places, and interests. CEO Mark Zuckerberg describes Facebook as a huge database and “just like a database, you should be able to query it”.</p>
<p>By allowing users to utilize the many datasets its collected over timed, formerly known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph">social graph</a>, Facebook hopes to deal a huge blow to a number of businesses including Google, LinkedIn, Help, and Match.com.</p>
<p>Alas, not everyone is excited. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2026229/facebooks-graph-search-raises-concerns-from-security-experts.html" title="Critics  " target="_blank">Critics </a>of Graph Search have pointed out potential privacy issues and concerns with the data’s validity. At the press event where Graph Search was unveiled, Zuckerberg attempted to calm the fears by educating users on how the new search tool interacts with user-controlled content.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/facebook-graph-search-1049_610x407-resized-600.jpg" alt="graph search privacy concerns" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"><span class="image-credit">(Credit: James Martin/CNET)</span></p>
<p>Another issue critics have with Graph Search is that results are limited the information that users decide to share. Most people have some level of privacy controls active on their profile, which places further emphasis on friend to friend interactions. A recent review on <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/01/facebook-graph-search-still-doesnt-speak-human/61529/" title="“The Atlantic Wire”" target="_blank">“The Atlantic Wire”</a> criticized Facebook for not understanding vague variations of the English language.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that Facebook will do with Graph Search as they do with every new feature or product – change it over time. The tool is still in the early beta stages and will evolve as it gradually rolls out to more users. In the meantime, let’s discuss how brands can optimize their pages for Graph Search.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bSji6Y66aKo" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Update your ‘About’ section</span></h3>
<p>Provide your physical address, phone number, website, etc. Double check your hours of operation as well. Take information from your website’s ‘About Us’ section and add the text here. Search engines can pick up on this information, so make sure your business description is an accurate and not overly complicated explanation of what you offer. This way, when fans who search for their friends who have ‘liked’ Italian restaraunts in Atlanta, Georgia, your chain of local eateries will float to the top of the results.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Encourage customers to leave recommendations</span></h3>
<p>Another huge aspect of Graph Search for brands is the integration of the recommendations section. Before Graph Search, recommendations was simply an odd ball content box on the right side of your profile. Now Graph Search will return results directly from this section, providing an in-house referral service. It’s very similar to what Yelp offers, except by building it on their own, Facebook has removed an extra step for its users.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Get more fans</span></h3>
<p>Graph Search can either be really good for your brand page, or not.</p>
<p>Currently, it doesn’t rely on keywords like Google (it's unclear if that's a good or bad thing). It relies on user connections and if your brand is lacking in the ‘connections’ area, don’t expect Graph Search to dramatically change your situation. To get the most out of this new feature, you need more fans. The way you get more fans is by providing<a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/125286/Content-Marketing-for-B2B-How-To-Amp-Up-Your-Web-Presence" title="  stellar content" target="_blank"> stellar content</a> and <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/?Tag=Facebook%20Marketing" title="ad targeting" target="_self">ad targeting</a>.</p>
<p>When a potential fan sees your brand in their search results, you want them to see you at your best. Take video and photos of your events such as customer appreciation parties. Tell your customers that you’re posting the pictures to Facebook and tell them to go tag themselves.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;">Check your category listings</span></h3>
<p>Category listings on Facebook are another easy way to increase your chances to be found through Graph Search. If you already have assigned one category listing, go add more. If you haven’t assigned any, Facebook assigned something for you that’s either accurate or inaccurate.</p>

      <title>How Planned Parenthood Used QR Codes to Promote Safe Sex</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Here at SearchDog Marketing, we get really excited when we come across unique applications of marketing tools. As more companies are focusing on digital campaigns, the use of quick response (QR) codes is on the rise. We tend to favor the out-of-the-box application of QR codes and the latest one we discovered more than meets that criteria.</p>
<p>In celebration of National Condom Week, the folks at Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest decided to use QR codes to encourage college students in the state of Washington to practice safe sex. In all, they distributed 50,000 condoms with QR codes printed on the wrappers. Once scanned, the codes allow people to check in to <a href="wheredidyouwearit.com">wheredidyouwearit.com</a> to let the world know where they practiced safe sex.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/ht_planned_parenthood_condoms_qr_code_ll_120301_wblog-resized-600.jpeg" alt="ht planned parenthood condoms qr code ll 120301 wblog resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>While the campaign only lasted for a week, the overall campaign reach of more than 4,500 check-ins and 65,000 visitors was very impressive considering the nature of the campaign itself. The site’s interactive map showed the condoms traveled from coast to coast and six continents. </p>
<p>According to Nathan Engbretson, new media coordinator for Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest, “this isn’t about bragging. It’s not about digital notches in your bedpost. Even if people have no desire to check in, they’re still getting the sense of how many people like them use condoms.”</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood described the site as “like Foursquare for people who don’t want a sexually transmitted infection.”</p>
<p>Not only did the site allow users to use geo-tags to show where they practiced safe sax, it also allowed them to share their age, gender, and why they chose to use condoms. Users could even provide age and gender information for their sex partners. Additionally, they could rate their sex experience.  </p>
<p>Engbretson told <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/03/01/condom-codes-let-users-check-in-to-safe-sex/">ABC News</a> that 20% of the traffic came from mobile devices. He said that after the campaign concluded, he planned to analyze the data and tailor a marketing campaign for those people. </p>
<p>This very cool QR code application has got us thinking. Can QR codes impact behavioral changes? If so, what other ways could we use QR codes to encourage positive behavior?</p>

      <title>Top 4 Ways to Optimize Your Facebook Fan Page for Search Engines</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><a href="http://facebook.com/searchdogmarketing" target="_self"><img id="img-1358174577902" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-14%20at%209.41.49%20AM-resized-600.png" alt="search dog marketing social media marketing" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Contrary to the rumor mill, it is possible to optimize your Facebook Fan Page for search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. True enough, you should not expect to see the same type of rich content from your Facebook Fan Page as your website. However, search engines will display more than enough information to funnel people to your fan page with ease. </p>
<p><b>Why Optimizing Social Media Is Important</b></p>
<p>Optimizing social media accounts to rank well in search engines may seem unnecessary to some, but it actually holds a lot of value to social media marketing. The key to remember is that your social media presence should not take the place of your website. It would be quite backwards to think your fan page should be outdoing your website in terms of content. Instead of thinking of these two sites as competing, think of them as complementary. Your Facebook Fan Page should be an extension of your web presence, constantly linking users back to your website and back into the sales funnel.</p>
<p>In this blog, we will provide the top four ways to optimize the search engine optimization of your Facebook fan page. When someone searches for your business Facebook fan page, the search engine automatically pulls up the title tag, meta description, and correlating images.</p>
<p><b>Top 3 Ways to Optimize Your Facebook Fan Page for Search Engines</b></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">1 – Customize Your Vanity URL</span></strong></p>
<p>Once you have surpassed the threshold of 24 fan page Likes, Facebook allows you to create a shorter, more user-friendly, custom vanity URL (also called a username). Just as with websites, search engines love URLs, so it is best to align it with your business name as much as possible.</p>
<p>On the off chance that someone else already created an unauthorized Facebook page in your business’ name, you can claim that page and any Likes it has, after showing a bit of proof that you are the real business owner.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>2 – Status Updates Serve as Meta Descriptions  </strong></span></p>
<p>While meta descriptions will not help you rank any higher in search engines, they are the information that search engines pull automatically. Meta descriptions are displayed whether you like it or not, so why not leverage it for social media marketing purposes? When it comes to Facebook, the first 18 words of your status update serves as your meta description in search engines. See the example below.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-14%20at%208.35.06%20AM-resized-600.png" alt="Facebook Fan Page Meta Description" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>A good practice to follow is to add a link back to your website every time you update your status.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>3 – Place Keywords Strategically</strong></span></p>
<p>Search engines crawl social media sites for keywords the same way they do websites. Although the crawl is not as thorough, Facebook allows search engines to pick up your fan page name, about section, and meta description. It is critical that you pay close attention to these areas to you have high-ranking keywords in these positions. For Facebook fan page search engine optimization purposes, your page name is your SEO title, meta description is your page name and about section, and your heading 1 is your page name.</p>
<p>Remember to keep your about us section brief and to the point. This is not the time or place to list your company’s mission and values. Provide users with the information they need the most – business name, 1 sentence overview, phone number, and address. Local searchers will appreciate your brevity. If they want to find out more information, provide a link to your business website where more in-depth information can be found. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>4 – Choose a Fan Page Name </strong></span></p>
<p>Last but definitely not least is choosing an appropriate name for your Facebook fan page. While you may want to get creative here, we strongly discourage such behavior in this particular area. The more creative your name is, the more you are contributing to brand confusion. Your fan page name will serve as your SEO title, so it is important to make sure you are being consistent. Use your company name, nothing else. Do not try to stuff keywords behind your company name, because it will not get you anywhere on Facebook or search engines. </p>
<p>While there are many myths out there about what boost the search engine optimization of your Facebook fan page, you can only be certain about what Google displays in search engine results. We know for a fact that they show these four key elements, so focus your efforts there.</p>

      <title>How to Use Google+ Communities to Boost SEO</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Google+ continues to roll out features to encourage its users to become more active. One of their newest features is Google+ Communities, which comes at a great time since LinkedIn decided to axe its events application not too long ago.</p>
<p><img id="img-1357826834745" src="/Portals/123780/images/screen%20shot%202013-01-04%20at%201.13.54%20pm-resized-600.png" alt="How to use Google+ communties for SEO" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>This update has caused a bit of a frenzy amongst social media marketers to quickly jump on the bandwagon to create Google+ communities. In this blog, we will explain what Google+ Communities are and provide examples of ways marketers can leverage this tool on a local level.</p>
<p><b>Think Strategy – </b>Contrary to what you read in popular social media blogs, every brand should not invest in every social media tool available on the market. Before you decide to join the whirlwind of Google+ Community creators, take some time to research what is already out here. Try to leverage your brand by joining communities related to your personal (keep it tasteful) and professional interests.</p>
<p>Practice <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/149483/Monitoring-Social-Media-for-Market-Research-and-Content-Ideas">social media listening and monitor the conversations</a> and posts before jumping into the mix. Think of a <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing-strategy-guide/">social media strategy</a> that would best position your brand or clients brand without overtly coming off salesly. The more personable, original, and authentic you can be, the better.</p>
<p><b>Public or Private Community</b> – If you decide to create a Google+ community, one of the most important decisions you will need to make early on is whether or not the community should be private or public. From a marketing standpoint, you should have a public community to make it easier for people to join. However, there are benefits to having a private community for certain brands.</p>
<p>For example, if you own a crisis center or women’s shelter and want to create an encouraging, but safe digital space for abused women. In this case, a private community would be best. However, if you are the owner of a local bar and want to connect with beer enthusiasts in the city, a public group is the way to go.</p>
<p><b>Develop a Small, Niche Community</b> – When you read about the millions of users on Google+, it is easy to get high expectations about create a large community. The reality of Google+ is that the number of <em>active </em>users is not that impressive. Unless you are a big brand or public figure, your Google+ circles are most likely not in the millions. We’re here to tell you that’s OKay. Don’t get down on yourself. Google+ is still very new to the social media game and the developers are still, well, developing. Instead of aiming to create a large community, focus on creating a small, niche community. Massage the growth over time. Integrate your Google+ community with the rest of your social media efforts. Do not give up.</p>
<p><b>Create Events</b> – Google definitely outdid themselves with <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/events/">Google+ Events</a>. Not only can you create custom invitations, but you can automatically add them to your Google Calendar and share photos in real-time. Everyone who takes photos at you event can post them in one space instead of linking out to multiple photo albums. Pretty cool, huh? </p>
<p><b>Start Hangouts</b> <b>With Key Audiences or Targeted Personas </b>– Want to meet the members of your community face-to-face? Meeting in the cloud is super easy now that <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google+ Hangout</a> is integrated with Google+ Communities. You can video conference with up to 10 people for free from the comfort of your computer, smartphone or tablet. As if that wasn’t enough, you can also broadcast your Google+ Hangout live on your profile.</p>

      <title>3 Other Cool Photo-Sharing Alternatives to Instagram</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Instagram’s recent terms of service debacle has many users feeling iffy about continuing their relationship after January 19 – when the new service and privacy agreements take effect.</p>
<p>Even after their attempt to “make it right” by reverting back to the original agreement verbiage with a few new additions, this unfortunate series of events has shaken many users’ faith in the Facebook owned, photo-sharing app. Prior to the Facebook buy out, Instagram supposedly had “no revenue and no business model.” Today, we all know the story to be quite different. From a consumer/user standpoint, the mistrust of Facebook is at an all-time high.</p>
<p>But are you really going delete your Instagram account? Some users have done just that, but millions continue posting photos faithfully. If you would like to leave the Instagram community, but can’t bear to go without posting your photos with a swanky filter, we have a few other photo sharing options for you to try out.

      <title>Facebook Announces Inbox Test: Pay $1 to Message Strangers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>By now you probably heard about Facebook’s latest attempt to monetize itself – charging $1 for messaging someone you are not friends with. Kudos to the marketing department for trying to spin this as an “inbox delivery test” in the <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/558/Update-to-Messaging-and-a-Test">official blog post</a>, but truth be told this move is no different from what most dating sites and LinkedIn are already doing.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-01%20at%2010.03.45%20PM-resized-600.png" alt="Facebook Inbox Filtering" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>According to their blog, Facebook is testing to improve the deliverability of relevant messages. The test gives a small percentage of American users the option of paying $1 to have their message hit someone’s personal inbox instead of the dreaded ‘Other’ folder.</p>
<p>If you have never checked your ‘Other’ folder, do not be alarmed. It most likely contains spam and other random messages from people you have no connection with. Facebook does us all a huge favor by using algorithms to determine which messages are spam and which are actually relevant based on social connections. Imagine what your inbox would look like without these controls in place. It would likely mirror your personal email inbox and no one wants to deal with that on a social media site.</p>
<p>In an effort to deter abuse, users can pay to message someone’s inbox one time per week. The company shared their thoughts on other benefits of charging to message people out of your network:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-02%20at%2010.05.25%20AM-resized-600.png" alt="Facebook Inbox Deliverability Test" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>So, this seems like it has the makings of a great advertising tool, right? Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Facebook fan pages and businesses are not part of this test at the present. They intend to see how this test plays out in the coming months. In the meantime, this news serves as a great distraction from the Instagram terms of service fiasco of December 2012.</p>
<p>In addition to charging $1 to message out of network users, Facebook announced several other updates to messaging and messenger.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #800000;">New Filtering Options: Basic vs. Strict Filtering </span></b></p>
<p>When basic filtering is active, messages from <span style="color: #800000;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">your friends</span></b></span> and <span style="color: #800000;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">friends of friends</span></b></span> will go to your inbox. If you previously had your setting on ‘friends of friends’ or ‘everyone’, basic filtering is now active.</p>
<p>Likewise, strict filtering allows you to receive message from only <span style="color: #800000;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">your friends.</span></b></span> If your previous setting was ‘friends’, strict filtering is now active.</p>
<p>With these new filtering options, you will likely receive messages in your inbox that you hadn’t before.  Here are the types of messages you will now receive:</p>

      <title>5 Reasons Why You Need a Digital Marketing Strategy in 2013</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Digital%20marketing%20strategy%20for%202013-resized-600.jpeg" alt="Whats your digital marketing strategy for 2013?" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" border="0">Are you like the millions of other businesses out there who are conducting digital marketing without a defined strategy? Do not worry. 2013 is the perfect time to get on the right track.</p>
<p>Let’s start by explaining what we mean by ‘digital marketing’ and ‘digital marketing strategy’.</p>
<p><b>Digital Marketing 101</b></p>
<p>The way you approach digital is a direct reflection of what you will get out of digital. If you are taking a sporadic, “get it done” approach that utilizes a handful of tactics without clear goals or objectives, you can expect a sporadic return on investment. Small businesses are the number one offenders of this approach.</p>
<p><b>What is a digital marketing strategy? </b></p>
<p>The phrase specifically refers to having a planned approach to the Internet driven channels you use to spread your message online. The same tenants of audience segmentation, targeting, propositions, and differentiation are still relevant in it comes to digital marketing just as traditional marketing.</p>
<p>Chances are, you are already conducting digital marketing in some shape or form. However, without a strategic approach, you are limiting your return and hurting your brand. Below we have listed 5 reasons why you need a digital marketing strategy.</p>
<ol></ol>
<b>1.    </b><b>You’re Missing Opportunities Online</b><ol></ol>
<p>Companies that do not have a digital marketing strategy are often unaware of the vast number of opportunities they miss by not having a set strategy in place. Simply put, without a concrete digital marketing strategy with clearly defined strategic goals, you are helping your competitors succeed where you have failed. Creating new relationships with potential customers and strengthening ties with existing ones is only possible if you are directing your digital marketing efforts down a set path.</p>
<ol></ol>
<b>2.    </b><b>You Don’t Know Your Online Customer Behavior</b><ol></ol>
<p>Sure, your website and social media sites are up and running. Do not make the mistake of thinking this is just a checkmark on a laundry list of business ‘must-haves’. In order to make these tools work for you, you must be able to monitor and evaluate your online customer behavior on a continual basis.</p>
<ol></ol>
<b>3.    </b><b>Digital Lacks Enough Resources to Make a Difference</b><ol></ol>
<p>Another common mistake made by business owners is not allocating enough financial and personnel support for digital marketing efforts. You will pay for underestimating the benefit of having a dedicated digital marketing budget in the short and long run. Think of your website and social media sites as vehicles that require maintenance, gas, and drivers. Without these things, can you truly expect the vehicles to operate at their full potential? The answer is no. Much like a vehicle, you can expect to have constant problems if you do not have neglect to invest money in the up-keep of your digital marketing strategy.</p>
<b>4.    </b><b>You’re Playing Catch-Up</b><ol></ol>
<p>Think of what you admire most about your top competitor. Top online brands have a way of staying on the cutting edge of digital marketing. They are testing and launching new approaches left and right, because they are armed with a digital marketing strategy that allows them to be agile enough to stay ahead of the game. If you find yourself constantly playing catch-up and never getting ahead of your competitors, it is time to re-think your current stance on digital marketing.</p>
<ol></ol>
<b>5.    </b><b>No Optimization or Recalibration Based on Analytics</b><ol></ol>
<p>Having Google Analytics running on your website is not enough. That is the minimum. The purpose of having analytics is to track customer behavior on your website AND recalibrate your approach based on what you see. Website performance impacts a number of digital marketing aspects including user experience, email and social media marketing, and search marketing. If you have any chance of achieving success in digital marketing, you must make sure that evaluation and recalibration is part of your strategy.</p>

      <title>How to Use Borrowed Relevance to Market Your Boring Business </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<div>For years, marketers have struggled with the age-old challenge of coming up with creative ways to market boring businesses. It appeared as though social media solved this, but sadly the medium is still NOT the message. </div>
<div></div>
<div>So, how do you market boring businesses? In order to answer this question, we must first introduce a new term - <span style="color: #800000;">"<a href="http://jeffrutherford.com/social-media-for-boring-products-and-services/"><span style="color: #800000;">borrowed relevance</span></a>"</span> - which means<em> creating an application that's about your customers' problems, and then leveraging that within your social application</em>.  </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img src="/Portals/123780/images/boring-content-resized-600.jpeg" alt="boring content resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></div>
<div></div>
<div>The main problem with marketing boring businesses is the lack of interesting topics and source content. But here at <span style="color: #800000;"><a href="/internet-and-online-marketing-in-atlanta/" title="SearchDog Marketing," target="_self"><span style="color: #800000;">SearchDog Marketing,</span></a></span> we are convinced that marketing boring businesses is a problem of creative perspective and a lack of understanding about 'borrowed relevance'.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Every boring business or product has an equally boring customer just itching to buy it. So, change your outlook and view this as an opportunity to connect with and engage your target audience in a manner unrelated to your product or service. Not only is there money to be made in solving customers' problems, but there's also endless content to design around them.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Take Starbucks for example.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img src="/Portals/123780/images/mystarbucksidea-resized-600.jpeg" alt="mystarbucksidea resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Coffee, even Starbucks Coffee, is in and of itself a boring product when it comes to an online presence. As tasty as it may be, it is a consumable product that does not require much discussion outside of 'may i take your order?'. So, they created a website called "<a href="http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/apex/idealist?lsi=0&amp;cat=Coffee+%26+Espresso+Drinks" shape="rect" target="_blank">My Starbucks Idea</a>" that encourages customers to submit and share ideas about Starbucks experiences, products, and involvement. Other customers can vote "for" or "against" one another's ideas and then Starbucks decides whether or not to implement the ideas. This is a perfect example of leveraging your audience's "problems"to advance the marketing of a boring product. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Insurance companies are by far the most boring businesses. Their struggle to engage online audiences in creative ways is shared equally among them all.</div>
<div></div>
<div><img id="img-1356010281413" src="/Portals/123780/images/LibertyResponsibility-GoldLevel_noborder_0-resized-600.gif" alt="LibertyResponsibility GoldLevel noborder 0 resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></div>
<div></div>
<div>Liberty Mutual Insurance branched out to create a website focused on what it means to do the right thing called <strong><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://responsibility-project.libertymutual.com/about#fbid=kWj-hsfB64W" shape="rect" target="_blank"><span style="color: #800000;">The Responsibility Project</span></a>.</span></strong> The site features articles and videos on issues of morality and responsibility. Liberty Mutual links to their social media sites and have integrated Facebook commenting on their articles. They managed to change the discussion from buying insurance to a much broader, more personable topic. All the while, they are engaging their target audience. </div>
<div></div>
<div>If you're still not getting the big picture about borrowed relevance, we'll spell it out for you.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How to Use Borrowed Relevance to Market Your Boring Business: </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>#1 -</strong></span> Invite your followers or customers to an online discussion about another brand. No matter what your industry is, chances are some of your customers care about popular topics like football, basketball, reality tv, news events, etc. This is the easiest form of borrowed relevance out there. When something major happens, make a post about it on your social media site with the goal of creating a discussion. Get a few people in your company to comment to get the ball rolling. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>#2 -</strong></span> Invite your followers or customers to an online discussion about their circumstances. A great example of this is Johnson and Johnson's (discontinued) Facebook page for mothers of children with ADHD. Parents are a great audience to tap into using the notion of borrowed relevance. They want to converse, share stories, and ideas with other parents about their children. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<strong><span style="color: #800000;">#3 -</span></strong> Take a cue from Liberty Mutual and start a discussion about your company's core values and build content around that. Make sure your values align with that of your target audiences. Every community has values, simply tap into the ones that are 'conversation friendly', create a place for it to live online,  and you've got yourself all the ingredients for a great discussion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>#4 -</strong></span> Use video to fill in the gaps if writing isn't your strong suit. You don't have to be the next Spike Lee to direct your own basic video and launch a YouTube channel. Even still video is not for everyone, so proceed with caution.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you are the proud owner of a booming, yet boring business, don't count your online marketing losses just yet. All is not lost. With a touch of creativity and a gallon of borrowed relevance, you can successfully engage your target audience and eventually generate leads. </div>
<div></div>
<div>We're here to help you get the ball rolling. </div>

      <title>How to Respond to Negative Comments on Social Media</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1355232770421" src="/Portals/123780/images/negative-comments-on-social-media.jpg" alt="how to respond to negative comments on social media" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" border="0">Nowadays business owners are obsessed with their rating on sites like Yelp, Google Places, and Facebook. Understandably so, when the average dissatisfied customers that feels ignored or simply mistreated by their company is liable to take their anger to public websites and replay their story for the masses. These experiences, forever stored online, deter potential customers and hurt your brand presence. It is no wonder that the first thing many business owners do each day is check their business pages on Yelp and Google Places.</p>
<p>If you have ever been in this position, you know very well the damage that negative comments holds for your business. Both Yelp and Google Places allows readers to mark reviews as helpful, funny, interesting, etc., which gives you a direct indication of what others are now thinking of your business.</p>
<p>What is the solution? There is no way definite to ensure every customer has a stellar experience with your business. If so, someone would have already invented and patented that approach. However, there are a few basic steps you can take to be proactive during customer interactions and on social media. These proactive steps can do a lot to offset the sheer number of negative comments and complaints.</p>
<p>In this blog, we will discuss 5 steps you can take to stay one step ahead of negativity online, close the loop, and ultimately recover clients.</p>
<p><b>Accept Your Fate</b></p>
<p>Crisis communication is nothing new for trained marketing and public relations professionals. Whether it involves crafting a concise response to critics or reporters, the need to respond to negative comments is unavoidable in this field and in the marketplace. Instead of avoiding and ignoring complaints and angry customers, accept that immediate responses and interactions are an expectation among customers in the age of digital media. There is no way around this fact and you will do more harm than good if you choose to put off answering negative comments online.</p>
<p><b>Plan Ahead</b></p>
<p>Part of being proactive is having a planned course of action before an incident takes place. You must decide if you will respond to each and every negative comment or if you will only respond to the complaints you can validate. Customers are smart people and they understand the value of a negative comment. Many use this to their advantage to get free products and services or even their 15 minutes of social media fame. Despite all of this, you are ultimately left with the decision of how to deal with real and false claims, because both can damage your brand presence.</p>
<p><b>Establish Rules</b></p>
<p>The above statement transitions nicely into the topic of offensive comments and how to deal with them. Our advice is to establish strict rules of engagement and stick to them. It is one thing for a customer to give details on the poor customer service they experienced, but it is quite another for them to be threatening or verbally abusive. This type of behavior should be heavily regulated and removed from your page immediately, because it has the potential to spread like wildfire. </p>
<p><b>Crowd Control</b></p>
<p>Every now and again, your loyal customers and fans will lash out against someone leaving a negative complaint. These situations can play out peacefully where a loyal customer simply shares their positive experience or answers the question of a complaining customer. Other times, these situations can become volatile and need to be diffused immediately. Monitor these situations carefully, because they can go sour very quickly.</p>
<p><b>Go Offline </b></p>
<p>Participating in a shouting match with a customer on social media is not a pretty sight. Instead of challenging someone’s complaints on a stage for the world to see, take the conversation offline immediately. Leave your email and phone number for the complainer in a private message. Make sure that your initial/public response to them indicates that you want to work things out on a more personal level. Others will see that you care enough to work towards a solution and the complaining customer will no longer have a need to post to negative comments.</p>
<p><b>Close the Loop</b></p>
<p>Even after taking the conversation offline, your work is not over. In order to close the loop, you must negotiate with that complaining customer in order to get them to either remove their statement or write a follow-up that lets the public know your business made the situation “right.” Although this sounds like an awkward conversation to have, it is a very necessary one. If you choose to not close the loop, you will have a string of negative comments with no resolution. Ultimately, you want the complaining customer to become a loyal customer in real life and on social media. Offer some bargaining chip and ask nicely that they share the happy ending with the world. Let them have the last <em>positive</em> word.</p>

<p>The holiday season has arrived and it is once again time for millions of shoppers to scour the Internet for holiday sales. Business owners and marketers anxiously wait for this glorious time to unveil their bag of promo offers to the masses. There’s only one problem. Your promotion strategy is outdated and you don’t have thousands of dollars to spend on a dazzling pay per click campaign to drive traffic to your website. Do not fear.</p>
<p>In this blog, we will give you four examples of ways to boost your holiday sales using inbound marketing tactics.</p>
<p><b>Holiday Gift Card</b></p>
<p>A great way to position yourself for success this season is to invest in branded, reloadable gift cards. They serve as an easy gift for the shoppers who are not good at choosing personal gifts. But gift cards do not have to be impersonal gifts. Add a personal touch by offering a special greeting card and envelope.</p>
<p><em>Takeaway:</em> Also, make sure that shoppers can purchase your gift card on your website. Create an individual landing page specifically for your gift card promotion.</p>
<p><b>Email Marketing Campaign</b></p>
<p><b><img src="/Portals/123780/images/how-to-boost-holiday-sales-resized-600.png" alt="how to boost holiday sales using inbound marketing" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"><br></b></p>
<p>Whether you decide to create a holiday gift card promotion or some other type, you should definitely take a cue from the major retailers and start an aggressive email marketing campaign. If you are like me, your inbox is inundated everyday with emails from Gap, Zara, ASOS, and other stores reminding me of their promotional offers. Not only are these emails provide friendly reminder; they make it easier for shoppers to purchase online by funneling you directly to the sale.</p>
<p><em>Takeaway: </em>Use Mail Chimp or Constant Contact to design an email newsletter; upload your customers email addresses; segment the list based on buyer frequency; and schedule emails to go out every morning to mid-afternoon. Hit people while they are in their offices with Internet access. Include a special discount code that gives shoppers an added percentage off. You have to generate a buzz about your promotion. <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/117443/5-Content-Strategy-Tips-for-Email-Marketers" title="Simply sending an email won’t be enough. Create VALUE." target="_self">Simply sending an email won’t be enough. Create VALUE.</a></p>
<p><b>Facebook Ads</b></p>
<p>Every marketer has an opinion about the effectiveness (or lack thereof) about Facebook ads. Say what you will, but companies are not spending millions in Facebook ads because they are ineffective. Quite the contrary, in fact, marketers who understand how to target audiences properly and choose the right posts to promote are <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/121035/How-To-Get-More-Facebook-Likes-By-Using-Facebook-Page-Post-Ads" title="having success with Facebook ads" target="_self">having success with Facebook ads</a>.</p>
<p><em>Takeaway: </em>Take your promotion design and post it to Facebook using a fun, but informative 1-sentence headline and include a bit.ly link to the specific landing page where your promotion lives. The key thing to remember about Facebook ads is that you should not post an entire paragraph and expect people to engage with it. Take a cue from Twitter and use minimal characters. The bit.ly link is also critical, because it allows you to understand what time shoppers clicked on your ad. This information is valuable to you; because it helps you better understand when your fans are on Facebook, so you can post during timeframe in the future. Promote that post for $5-$20 for a couple of days. Monitor the reach carefully. If more “friends of your fans” are engaging, you should create another ad targeting them only and so on and so on.</p>
<p><b>QR Codes &amp; Free Shipping Offers</b></p>
<p>Notice more QR codes this season? We sure have. Brands like The Home Depot use QR codes on Christmas trees while others are embedding them in email newsletters. However you decide to integrate a QR code into your holiday promotion, read over <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/160455/QR-Codes-To-Use-or-Not-to-Use" title="our recent blog about QR code usage." target="_self">our recent blog about QR code usage.</a></p>
<p>Another way to get shoppers excited about your holiday promotion is to offer free shipping. Shipping and handling costs are a huge deterrent for online shoppers, especially those who are not too keen on the idea of putting their credit card information on the Internet. Online shoppers are sacrificing their privacy and putting their identities at risk by purchasing gifts on your website, so give them something for free in exchange. It’s a simple way to say ‘thank you’ and let them know that you value their business.</p>
<p>Hopefully these tips have given you more ideas about how to boost your holiday sales using an inbound marketing approach. Everything you do should lead shoppers back to your website where the real magic happens. If you need any help, there is still time to get the word out online before December 24. Give us a call!</p>

      <title>3 Free Social Media Listening Tools You Should Be Using</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Listening to the online chatter about your brand is one of the easiest and cheapest activities you can do to manage and monitor your social presence. Why, then, are global companies spending thousands of dollars to hire people to ‘listen’ for them? That is a luxury that only the big brands can afford. In this blog, we will identify three, FREE listening tools for the savvy, small business marketer who works with little to no social media budget.</p>
<p>Before you decide to invest money to hire someone to do the listening for you or give up on the matter entirely, take heed to these no-cost social media listening tools and techniques.</p>
<h2>Why Social Listening Matters:</h2>
<p>Have you been the last person to hear a nasty rumor about yourself or your company? It’s a terrible feeling and a PR person’s worst nightmare. Being the last to know something negative about yourself, or in this case, your brand is not only embarrassing, it is deadly to your brand image. It could eventually hurt sales down the road. Listening to the conversations your customers, potential customers, and competitors have regarding your products, services, brand, and industry puts you in a position to set the record straight immediately.</p>
<h2>Social Media Listening Tools and Techniques:</h2>
<p>Now that you understand why listening matters and what you should listen for, it’s time to talk tools and techniques. Thanks to Twitter, the art of hashtagging has become wildly popular among social media users and marketers alike. In fact, not even Facebook can deny the ease and usability of hashtagging as a user-friendly search tool. Instagram (Facebook owned) uses still hashtags as a search method and integrates with Twitter by allowing users to publish photos onto Twitter directly from the app.</p>
<p>The ability to search keywords on Twitter and to utilize hashtags to spread a message are invaluable to listening and monitoring your brand. You can create original hashtags or piggyback off a trending topic or hashtag from Twitter. The main thing to remember is that if you are creating an original hashtag with the hopes of it going viral, make it easy to remember and as short as possible. The longer it is, the harder it will be to remember or use on Twitter (keep in mind the character count).</p>
<p>So, here are three free listening tools to help monitor your brand online.</p>
<p><a href="http://hootsuite.com" title="Hootsuite" target="_self"><b>Hootsuite</b></a></p>
<p><b><img src="/Portals/123780/images/social-listening-tool-resized-600.jpg" alt="Hootesuite is a social media listening tool for all types of businesses" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"><br></b></p>
<p>Hootsuite offers a free version with limits and paid version if you want to access analytics and have multiple team members/collaborators on one account. The basic free version will suffice because it offers a robust set of features that allow you to create columns for your different social media accounts. From these columns, you can monitor your followers/fans in real-time, make comments, retweet, follow, like, and of course – search. Not only should you use Hootsuite to monitor your brand, but also your competitors brand as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/alerts" title="Google Alerts" target="_self"><b>Google Alerts</b></a></p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/social-media-listening-tool-google-alerts-resized-600.jpg" alt="Google Alerts is a great social media listening tool to help track brand mentions and keyword activity" border="0"></p>
<p>Google is the king of search. That goes without saying. Google Alerts is just one more reason Google continues to reign supreme in the realm of online search. It allows you to enter search queries that you want to monitor and have them emailed to you in real-time. Unfortunately, Google Alerts only monitors search engines, not social media. That does not take away the fact that it is an amazing way to stay posted on what your competitors do on the Internet, get the latest on developing news stories, and receive immediate notification when new content is posted about your brand. A good way to start is to set up alerts for your brand name, product category, CEO’s name, and competitors.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialmention.com/" title="Social Mention" target="_self"><b>Social Mention</b></a></p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/social-media-listening-tool-social-mention-resized-600.jpg" alt="Social Mention is a great social media listening tool that helps you track keywords and brand mentions on social networking sites" border="0"></p>
<p>Social Mention is basically Google Alerts for social media. It will send you real-time alerts for search queries. You can have alerts emailed to you or do instant searches using the field on the homepage. Social Mention monitors an astounding 100+ social media sites including the most popular ones: Twitter, Google+ and YouTube. FYI: Facebook has made a point of not allowing other sites to crawl their site, so the only real way to monitor your brand is by using their analytics and watching engagement on your brand’s page.</p>
<p>With these three free tools as part of your listening dashboard, you can get a pretty good idea of what folks are saying about your brand, industry, and competition. Are you already practicing the art of social media listening? What tools are you using?</p>

      <title>How to Simplify Your Social Media Tasks Using IFTTT</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><span>Wouldn't it be great if every time someone tweeted you, it was automatically archived in Evernote? </span></p>
<img id="img-1349100652469" src="/Portals/123780/images/ifttt%20logo-resized-600.png" alt="ifttt logo" class="alignLeft" style="font-size: 13.333333015441895px; float: left;" border="0"><p>Seems a bit far fetched, right? Wrong. This and much more is possible with a new web service called IFTTT. Pronounced, “lift” without the l, IFTTT literally stands for "If That Then Then This."</p>
<p><span>This service does far more than any social media tool we have encountered thus far. I</span><span>t's designed to "put the internet to work for you" by creating simple tasks with the Web services you already use based on the "if that then this" premise.  In this blog, we will clearly explain what ifttt is, which Web services it works with, and ways it can simplify your social media marketing duties. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>What is IFTTT?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>It's a service that allows users to connect with their social media accounts to create automatic responses based on the guise of ‘if that happens, then do this.’ Essentially, everyone who uses ifttt becomes an amateur programmer, due to the 'if that then this' conditional formula used to automate social media tasks. For example," IF someone tweets #searchdogmarketing, save it in my Evernote." That's a very simple example, but there are endless possibilities as to what tasks one can create. </span></p>
<p><span>So, let's break down the 'if that then this formula' to get a concrete understanding of what it means and can do.</span></p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-01%20at%2010.12.06%20AM-resized-600.png" alt="ifttt formula" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p><span>A<span style="color: #800000;"><strong> Task</strong></span> is the basic formula that ifttt operates on - "if that then this." </span></p>
<p><span>A <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Channel</strong></span> represents the Web services that work with ifttt to complete a task. Currently, ifttt works with a total of 52 sites. That's more than enough to go around. Here's the full channel menu, so you can see what services are connected. If you don't see what you need, <span style="color: #800000;"><strong><a href="https://ifttt.com/contact" title="contact (https://ifttt.com/contact)" target="_self"><span style="color: #800000;">contact (https://ifttt.com/contact)</span></a></strong> </span>the folks at ifttt and let them know. </span></p>
<p><span>A <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Trigger</strong></span> is the 'this' part of the task, which has a long list of channels to choose from.</span></p>
<p><span>An <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Action</strong></span> is the 'that' part of the tasks, which also works with the 52 channels. </span></p>
<p><span>A<strong> <span style="color: #800000;">Recipe</span></strong> saves tasks that can be shared with others using ifttt. This is especially cool, because ifttt users do not have to reinvent the wheel when creating commonly used recipes. Chances are that someone already created the task you want, so check the recipes listed below before jumping head first into this thing. </span></p>
<p><span>How often do tasks check for new data? Every 15 minutes like clockwork. However, you have the option to refresh manually.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that you understand the logic behind the ifttt formula, let's go into more detail about how this service simplifies your social media marketing duties.</span></p>
<p><span>As was stated earlier in this blog, you can save yourself some time and frustration by browsing the list of<strong> <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes" title="recipes (https://ifttt.com/recipes)" target="_self">recipes</a></strong> already created by other ifttt users.  There's no need to reinvent the wheel.</span></p>
<p><span>Below is a list of popular recipes for common tasks.</span></p>

      <title>Tips to Spice Up Your Boring Business Marketing Approach</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The age-old problem of 'how to create exciting marketing strategies for boring businesses' continues to boggle the minds of hard-working marketers everywhere. <img id="img-1347295586169" src="/Portals/123780/images/boringbusiness-resized-600.jpeg" alt="boringbusiness resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" border="0"></p>
<p>Here at Search Dog Marketing, we are convinced this is merely a problem of perspective. Every boring business or product has an equally boring customer just itching to buy it. If you change your outlook on the situation, you can begin to understand this conundrum as an issue of audience targeting and not turning the boring into something cool.  </p>
<p>Simply put, niche products belong to niche audiences. To sell a niche product, you have to identify who is willing to purchase it not once, but over and over again. Find the consumer who understands the product and has a definite need for it. Where there is need, purchases are made. The trick is to understand your customer’s motives for purchasing and to keep your brand at the top of their minds. </p>
<p>Easier said than done. Here are a few tips to help find ways to make marketing niche products more effective:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Try Using Video </b></span></p>
<p>Words get boring quickly. The truth is that not many people enjoy reading as much as they used to. With all the entertainment options available, why would they? The best way to spice up your boring niche is to create a flashy video about it. Video and comedy go hand in hand. Unless you own a funeral home, you should be able to come up with a funny 30-second clip to share.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Hire Professional Copywriters to Craft Your Messages</b></span></p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing more snooze worthy than reading boring copy about a boring niche. Give yourself and your potential customers a break from the monotony. By turning the writing over to the pros, you are guaranteed to receive lively, clear, and easy to understand content. Content marketing is a full time job and writing is a craft, so do not attempt to overwhelm yourself by trying to master a new skill. Outsource.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Be Funny</b></span></p>
<p>There is room for laughter in the driest of industries. Yours is no different. Even if you struggle to create funny, witty content, the professional copywriters we suggested in the previous paragraph should be able to come up with something. Whether you put on a Facebook or Twitter contest or conduct an company pie eating contest, create something funny that will get mileage online.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Find Your Audience and Stick With Them</b></span></p>
<p>The saying goes “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure”. The same is true for niche products or services. What one person finds useless is the best thing since sliced bread to another. The key is to find that other and stick with them. Identify opportunities, find your audience, and supply them with engaging content. Your marketing strategy does not have to appeal to the masses, just those that will actually buy it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Give Freebies</b></span></p>
<p>Picture frames are a boring niche, but free picture frames are a hot commodity. Basically anything free is fair game. Sad to say but when the most boring business decides to give their product away they suddenly become to popular kid at recess. This is a tried and true marketing strategy. You can either give your product away or free tickets to the local, rivalry football game. Be sure there is value attached to what you are giving. </p>
<p><span>Boring niches aren’t going anywhere. They have just as much need for a strong marketing strategy as the next guy. The key is to find the right audience and dazzle them and only them. Loosen up a bit, hire a professional copywriter or marketing firm to craft your messages, and let them build you some great content that will pull potential customers to your website. Being a do-it-yourselfer can cause more harm than good if you aren’t careful. Your friends at Search Dog Marketing are ready to help you!</span></p>

      <title>How to Capitalize on LinkedIn's Redesign of Company Pages</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<div>LinkedIn recently made a few design changes to company pages which is good news for marketers and professionals using the site to expand their network. </div>
<div></div>
<div>On September 6, LinkedIn's company pages received a substantial facelift, but this change only went into effect for a small number of companies. According to their <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/09/06/new-look-for-company-pages/" title="blog announcement" target="_self">blog announcement</a>, all of LinkedIn's users will receive this new look later in the year. Thankfully, our pals at Hubspot have some clout and were included in the early launch. We'll use their page as a reference, along with some others. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img id="img-1349105712232" src="/Portals/123780/images/lcp-resized-600.png" alt="lcp resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></div>
<div><em>*taken from LinkedIn's blog</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>The reason for making these changes is pretty simple - LinkedIn wants to be more than a professional networking and job search site. With 160 million+ users, they definitely have the membership to be much more than a glorified Monster.com. It's a known fact that any web design changes, no matter how big or small, impact the user's experience. LinkedIn's recent changes will indeed impact user experience and hopefully increase user engagement which will lead to stronger relationships on the site. A LinkedIn spokesperson was recently quoted in a TechCrunch article related to this matter specifically.</div>
<div></div>
<div>From TechCrunch:</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>“We are always looking for ways to make it easier for LinkedIn members to get more value out of our services by creating simpler, more relevant experiences, so we are currently testing a new design for the LinkedIn homepage with a handful of members,” he told TechCrunch.</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>In this blog, you will learn what the design changes are and how they impact your use of LinkedIn company pages. You will also receive insight on how to drive traffic to your website using LinkedIn. While a number of the changes involve the same elements that have been a part of LinkedIn for a while, the redesign brings them to the forefront.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The design/user experience changes are as follows:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>New Cover Image </strong>-</span> </div>
<div><img id="img-1349106008364" src="/Portals/123780/images/cover-image-resized-600-resized-600.png" alt="linkedin cover image" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></div>
<div><em>*from Hubspot's blog</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>LinkedIn took a cue from Google+, Facebook, and most recently Twitter by creating their own cover image for company pages. This presents a perfect branding opportunity to feature your company logo and a custom header (646 x 220 pixels). Prior to the redesign, LinkedIn did not offer the ability to customize a company page in this way. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<em>Web traffic takeaway</em>- <em>Incorporate your web address or blog address in your cover art design. </em>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Company Updates Section -</strong></span></div>
<div>
<img src="/Portals/123780/images/company-updates-resized-600.png" alt="company updates resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"><em>*taken from Hubspot's blog</em>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>LinkedIn made a few changes in this area. First, they expanded this section to allow you to list more details about your company. Not only that, if you try to post an update to your company page, you should notice that LinkedIn provides a few suggestions about what you should share - either an article, ask a question, or post a special offer to interested LinkedIn members. Before the redesign took place, LinkedIn did not offer any advice on what content to update your members with.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Targeted updates</span> - You will still have the option of sharing your content with all of your followers or a segment of them. If you choose to get fancy and send your post to only a 'targeted audience,' you have the option of sending based on company size, industry, function, seniority, or geography. This is nothing new to LinkedIn. They simply made this tool more prominent on the page.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<em>Web traffic takeaway</em> - <em>Update your status often. It's the only way LinkedIn users will not forget about you. Be sure to include links leading back to your website which features more content for users to soak up. </em>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Analytics</span> - LinkedIn took another cue from Facebook regarding analytic feedback of individual posts. After you make a post on Facebook, it will automatically display an account of how many people saw your post. Go into the 'Insights' section and you can get a more detailed understanding of how people interacted with your post. LinkedIn does the same by offering a performance update that includes the number of clicks, shares, engagement percentage, and impressions. Again, this is nothing new to LinkedIn. They simply relocated these metrics in the redesign. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Products and Services - </strong></span>The Products and Services tab was relocated from the navigation bar to the right sidebar. It may sound like a small change, but the user experience benefits are promising. You can now feature your products and services prominently, whereas before they were not easy to see. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<em>Web traffic takeaway</em> - <em>Use this move and added exposure to direct viewers directly to the products and services on your website. </em>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>These are the 3 major changes to LinkedIn's company pages. Although these changes won't go into effect for all LinkedIn users until a later date, the benefits are evident through a brief examination of the profiles of the early adopters. It's clear that LinkedIn is serious about positioning themselves as more than a job search site. These changes should positively impact it's social media appeal and make the site more sticky overall. Stay tuned for design changes to your businesses company page.</div>

	<div>Sadly, QR codes are swiftly becoming a thing of the past in the realm of<img id="img-1349893756860" src="/Portals/123780/images/QR_code_billboard_28dayslater-resized-600.jpeg" alt="QR code billboard 28dayslater resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" border="0"> marketing. For a while, they were all the rage. You could find a QR (quick-response) on every possible promotional piece from brochures to t-shirts and even on the side of a city bus. But if you have ever taken the time to actually scan a QR code, nine times out of 10, you were disappointed with what you received for all your effort. </div>
<div></div>
<br><div>Industry leaders have already announced the impending death of QR codes, which some may think is a bit rash. However, when you look at the data and think back on your own desire (or lack thereof) to engage with QR codes, you can find some truth in their predictions.</div>
<div></div>
<br><div>In July, Inc. released an article written by Eric V. Holtzclaw titled <span style="color: #800000;">"<a href="http://www.inc.com/eric-v-holtzclaw/qr-codes-dont-bother-five-reasons.html"><span style="color: #800000;">QR Codes? Don't Bother. 5 Reasons."</span></a></span> In it, Holtzclaw does just what the title implies, he outlines 5 reasons marketers should not waste their time with QR codes. Adversely, I found numerous articles on reasons to do the exact opposite, but I think it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to what Holtzclaw has to say. His firm, User Insight, conducted a research study that identified several barriers to QR code success. </div>
<div></div>
<br><div>Here they are direct from INC.'s site:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>No one understands QR codes.</li>
<li>They require too much effort.</li>
<li>The purchase decision is made before encountering a QR code.</li>
<li>The result isn't worth the effort.</li>
<li>One bad QR code impacts all others.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are very realistic and rational reasons for not using QR codes in your next campaign. But I don't think we would still see so many QR codes in marketing today if they weren't successful for someone in some capacity. Point in case, Tesco, a Koren grocery store, has an amazing QR code success story. It's so amazing that you've got to see it for yourself, so watch the video below.</p>
<p> </p>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/h7HnR02kJxY" frameborder="0" height="315" width="420"></iframe>
<p>Obviously, not every business is in Tesco's position or industry to make QR codes be the solution to a marketing challenge. The video shows that QR codes still have a place in modern marketing. But keep in mind that QR codes don't need to be in every marketing piece and campaign you conduct. That's overkill. Only integrate QR codes in 'cool' situations when you truly want people to use them and when people will truly WANT to use them. Having a QR code on the side of a city bus is a good idea. When will people take the time to scan it? As they're getting on or off the bus? While the bus is parked briefly at a stop? It seems unlikely and awkward for the users. Make QR code a natural part of the experience and you'll get hits.</p>
<p>So, how can you do that? Below are 3 simple ways you can integrate QR codes naturally:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Point of Purchase</strong> </span>- As you're checking people out at the register, they have a few seconds or sometimes minutes to kill just waiting for the cashier to finish processing. These are valuable seconds that you should use to your advantage. This is the perfect time to have a QR code positioned at the point of purchase leading them to an exclusive offer of some kind. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Business Card</strong></span> - This may seem cheesy to some, but I've actually received business cards with QR codes and it was a cool experience. Make sure your cards are well-designed. Don't compromise a good design just for the sake of having a QR code. The code should compliment the design, not dominate it. It should also direct them to whatever site you want plan to generate the lead. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Direct Mail Piece</strong></span> - Catch people while they're at home and have some time to kill. Include the code on your next direct mail campaign. It's hard to get folks to stop and scan something while they're speed walking on a busy side walk or driving in a car. It's a much safer and more reasonable to place the code on a piece that will come directly to their homes. Build upon the relationship you already have with them by offering promo code or discount for scanning the code.</p>
<p>These are just a few ways you can naturally integrate QR codes in your marketing campaigns. But if you're anything like Holtzclaw, you're completely over QR codes and anyone who uses them. We get that. The key in every marketing tactic you decide to do is to be strategic. If QR Codes don't work for your audience or business, don't use them. But make sure you're using them the RIGHT way, if you decide to venture down that road.</p>

      <title>How to Maximize ROI with Direct Mail</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/maximize%20Roi%20with%20direct%20mail-resized-600.png" alt="maximize Roi with direct mail resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" border="0">Even with the rising popularity of email and Internet marketing, direct mail is still a powerful tool for generating sales leads and boosting your customer base. A large portion of the mail received daily by customers is advertisements and other marketing material. Many times, these items come out of the mailbox and go straight to the garbage can.</p>
<p>The key to getting the most from your direct mail campaigns is proper optimization. Doing this will not only increase conversions and boost ROI but can also drop to overall expenses attributed to your mailing campaigns. These tactics will help to reduce waste and boost the benefits of any direct mailing campaign.</p>
<p><b>Target Properly &amp; Test</b></p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of any direct marketing campaign is proper targeting. Targeting makes it easier to analyze results, improve conversions and expand your market. This targeting and research will also influence nearly every aspect of your flyers, postcards or other mailed items. How you choose to categorize and target your client base is largely dependent on your product and your preference. Good starting points include age, gender and income level.</p>
<p>Once you have determined the ideal target for your campaigns and drafted your materials, conduct a small test sample and check your results.</p>
<p><b>Use smart envelope practices</b></p>
<p>Once you know that you are targeting the proper audience, the next step is to get the customer to open your direct mailings. Setting yourself apart from the rest of the mail in their box is a great way to accomplish this. One of the most effective ways to increase the chances of customer engagement is to personalize your mailing. Instead of using standard envelopes, bulk labels and printed postage consider directly printing your envelopes with a handwriting-inspired font and applying stamps manually.</p>
<p>Adding a return address using your name can add additional personalization and make the customer feel connected with your company or cause. Of course, getting the customer to open your mailers is only half the battle.</p>
<p><b>Capture attention quickly</b></p>
<p>The next component to increasing ROI for direct mailing is to capture the customer's attention with a strong headline. You only have a split second to do so before they decide to continue reading or discard your package. Headlines should be concise and convey the ideas of your marketing materials. Invoking emotions and creating a reaction are important to entice the reader to read further.</p>
<p>Once you have their attention, you can make your pitch. Presenting information using easy to understand visuals and breaking information up using lists and headings can help the reader to skim through your information while still receiving your intended message.</p>
<p><b>Call to action</b></p>
<p>After your pitch, you should always include a call to action. Doing this in a "p.s." section can help to boost conversion rates as well. This is also a place to use scarcity tactics, such as limited time or quantity promotions.</p>
<p>The final component in boosting ROI is to be sure to tie your direct mailing efforts in with your other media. Include contact information, such as phone numbers or email addresses, as well as social media or website information with each mailing. This provides plenty of options for the customer to interact with your business and more opportunities for you to capture their attention. Unifying your branding and promotions across all of your advertising platforms can also help to increase conversions by creating a sense of familiarity and ensuring the customer remembers your brand and company.</p>

      <title>7 Tools To Help You Understand Your Customers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><b>Bryant Jaquez is the <em>CRO SEO</em> who owns the creative inbound marketing and <a href="http://www.brewseo.com/web-design-and-web-development/" target="_blank">web design</a> company, BrewSEO.  You should follow him on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/brewseo" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. </b></p>
<p>In-bound Marketing is starting to grow up a little bit.  Over the past few years, I have noticed a trend that in-bound marketers are starting to act more like marketers and less like magicians.  More specifically, I think we are starting to put an appropriate amount of focus on the user, instead of focusing exclusively on machines. SEO's are starting to adopt semantic keyword research as part of their normal repertoire.  We understand that matching a "customers intent" is the most important factor in on-site optimization.  CROs are starting to focus their tests on getting to know customers instead of just re-publishing tests that other CRO companies blog about.  I am proud to say that I am part of this community, and I'm happy to see it continue to develop its reputation. </p>
<p>I have found that my ability to help a company grow is directly tied to my ability to understand their customers. Next time you start a CRO project, try to focus on getting to know what your customers think about your website. Are there things that scare them, or make them feel uncomfortable?  Is your website missing information that they need, and are you providing an appropriate balance between social-cues, sales copy, and an unobtrusive user experience?  In the vein of helping us all take one more step towards focusing on our customers, here are 7 tools that will help you get to know your customers, and suggestions on how to use them to grow your bottom line.</p>
<p><b>1. <a href="https://qualaroo.com/" title="Qualaroo" target="_self">Qualaroo</a></b>: </p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Survey%20your%20customers-resized-600.jpg" alt="Survey your customers resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>Qualaroo is a customer survey and conversion tool that will give you the ability to ask your customers questions about their user experience.  You can add surveys "on exit" when a customer abandons your shopping cart. Ask them why they are leaving, and ask what you could have done to make their shopping experience better. Remember that your goal is to get to know your customers, and find out how to serve them better.  Run a few surveys and try to find out how your website is falling short. </p>
<p><b>2. <a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/" title="Crazy Egg" target="_self">Crazy Egg</a> and MouseFlow</b>:</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/track%20where%20your%20customers%20eyes%20go-resized-600.jpg" alt="track where your customers eyes go resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>These are two tools that I love.  Crazy Egg has more features than Mouse Flow, but Mouse Flow has a free version, and for that reason I use it when I'm working with a low-budget project or one of my personal blogs. Both of these tools give you the ability to watch visitors browse through your site.  You can see how far down the page they scroll, where they click, where they pause, and you can track their mouse and it moves throughout your website. </p>
<p>Use this tool to find parts of your website that are confusing.   Are people clicking on a page element that "looks like a button" or are they scrolling down the page quickly, and then leaving when they don't find something? The benefit of these tools is that you can watch people in action, instead of just reading numbers in a Google Analytics report.  I recommend you combine the insights you gather in this tool with a qualaroo survey.  For example, If you find that people are scrolling to the bottom of your contact page, and then leaving your website put a survey on that page that says "Hi there, is there something specifically that you are looking for?" </p>
<p><b>3. <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/" title="Survey Monkey" target="_self">Survey Monkey</a>: </b></p>
<p><b><img src="/Portals/123780/images/customer%20surveys-resized-600.jpg" alt="customer surveys resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"><br></b></p>
<p>Survey Monkey is the one of the best survey tools in the world, and they have a free plan that allows anyone to try them out.  You can use Survey Monkey to get free answers to questions that would usually require you set up an expensive focus group to discover.   Ask them questions about your company.  For example: ask, "How would  you explain our service to your friends."  This question will give you a glimpse into your customers understanding of your services.  You can use the answers they give you in the sales copy of your website. Additionally, you will discover whether or not your customers properly understand what you do.  Maybe everyone thinks you are a plain-jane sticker company when in reality you sell <a href="http://www.thedecalguru.com/macbook-decals" target="_blank">clever macbook decals</a>.  If you discover areas of confusion among your customers you can modify your website to address those issues. </p>
<p><b>4. <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" title="Mail Chimp" target="_self">Mail Chimp</a></b>:</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/email%20your%20customers-resized-600.jpg" alt="email your customers resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>Mail Chimp is my favorite newsletter service, and it also integrates with Survey Monkey.  You can use this to send out surveys to everyone in your mailing list.  Newsletters are one of the most powerful ways to stay in touch with your customers.  In addition to sending traditional surveys, you can also embed a small Q/A form at the bottom of your email template that asks a simple question.  Use this as a method of constantly gathering customer feed-back.  I suggest you ask questions that will help you improve your customer service and newsletter programs.  You can ask your customers something like "is there anything you would like to see in our newsletters that we are leaving out?"  How powerful will your newsletters become if it is exactly what your customers want them to be. </p>
<p><b>5. Internal Search</b>:</p>
<p>Internal Search is by far one of the most under-used tools that will give you one of the quickest ROIs.  When I worked for a popular computer repair company, we used internal search as a content creation tool.  Sometimes our customers would search for information about a "computer is glitchy" instead of just seating for "computer repair."  We recorded every search performed in our search bar and used that data to write blog posts, and service pages.  Once 5 or more people searched for the same obscure phrase, we would make a service page for that keyword.  This gave us a constant collection of long-tail keywords, and customers were always happy to find pages that matched their unusual search queries. </p>
<p><b>6. Customer Service</b>: </p>
<p>We are getting towards the bottom of the article, and in proper "BrewSEO" fashion, I've saved one of the best tips for the bottom of the article.  This is how I reward people who read all the way through. Your customer service team is on the front lines of usability.  Everyday they field calls from customers who are unhappy with your company, and who have problems that they need help resolving.  Sit down with your customer service team on a regular basis.  Ask them to start keeping lists (in a shared google docs spreadsheet) of common customer complaints. </p>
<p>Here are a few questions that you can ask your customer service reps: "What are some of the most common questions people ask you?"  If your customers need to call in to ask a question, it is probably because they can't find that information on your website.  Invest your time in your customer service team.  They will give you more insight into your cutters than almost any other resource in your company. </p>
<p><b>7. Customer Support Menue Tab</b>: </p>
<p>Sometimes your customers just want to vent, make it easy for them to do that.  Most importantly, make it easy for them to vent to you, because that will keep them from spewing their unpleasant experience all over facebook.  Add a customer support tab to your navigation menu.  Your customers will find it when they want to tell you something, and take my word for it, do not take their complaints for granted.  Use your customer support form as a way of improving your company, your website, and your customer service.  If you need further clarification about anything your customers suggest, create a questionnaire with one of the above-mentioned tools. </p>
<p>These 7 tips are only the beginning, use them as a spring board to help you get to know your customers. The more understanding you have into your target market, the quicker you will grow.  This will help every aspect of your SEO, CRO, PPC, Social Media….etc. Basically, this will help every part of your business. </p>

<p>Well it’s about time.  Google finally launches it’s “disavow tool,” a way for site owners to tell Google which links pointing to their site should be ignored.  SEO’s and webmasters have been begging for a tool like this since many began receiving “unnatural linking warnings” in their webmaster tools accounts.  With the addition of the Penguin update and the fact that Bing launched their own tool months ago, it only makes since for Google to give webmasters a way to clean up their backlink profile.  Thanks GoogleJ  You can follow the author on Twitter @basvandenbeld.</p>

<p>Although Google admits that social signals are not currently a large factor in their ranking algorithm, it’s inevitable that at some point these types of signals will play a major part in how a site is ranked.  If Google doesn’t use these social signals, at some point sites like Facebook and Twitter become a huge threat.  I believe that Google+ authorship is one way that Google is attempting to measure a author/sites social influence and will become more and more important as time goes by.  This article gives some excellent tips on how to leverage your authorship and be ahead of your competition.  You can follow the author on Twitter @kevgibbo.</p>

      <title>4 Ways to Create and Curate Content With Instagram</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<div><img id="img-1350403984331" src="/Portals/123780/images/instagram-resized-600.jpeg" alt="create curated content with instagram" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></div>
<div>It is no secret that social media has turned the average Internet user into a photographing, tagging, and hastaging addict. In fact, the latest study conducted by the <span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Online-Pictures/Main-Findings/Online-Life-in-Pictures.aspx"><span style="color: #800000;">Pew Foundation</span></a></span> released some eyebrow raising findings that confirm as much. In a report titled "Photos and Videos as Social Currency Online," Pew found out this about almost half of all adult Internet users:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>46% of adult internet users post original photos or videos online that they themselves have created. </li>
<li>41% of adult internet users take photos or videos that they found online and repost them on sites designed for sharing images with many people. </li>
</ul>
<div>Social media sites like Instagram and Pinterest are the primary reasons for this trend of content creators and curators. Not to mention the unprecedented amount of people who own smartphones. </div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>A surprising 12% of online adults say they use Instagram, which is primarily used by young adults. Twenty-seven percent of internet users are between the ages of 18-29 use Instagram.<span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3001670/instagram-now-bigger-twitter-us-mobiles"><span style="color: #800000;"> ComScore</span></a></span> reports that Instagram, now owned by Facebook, has 7.3 million daily users whereas Twitter has a mere 6.9 million. Sad news for Twitter, but great news for Facebook who has set its sights on dominating mobile/social arena.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Based on findings from both Pew and ComScore, it's clear that your marketing efforts should be integrating Instagram. If you're like most business owners, you have little time to investigate and test new marketing strategies. But if you have a social media presence at all and find it difficult to create or curate content on a regular basis, you'll find plenty of value in the remainder of this blog.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>How to Use Instagram to Create and Curate Content</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>#1 - Promote your blog posts</strong></span> - It should go without saying that a photo of some kind should accompany every blog you post on your company's website. So, take that photo, your blog title, and a link and push it out via Instagram. Use hashtags to target help drive traffic. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>#2 - Use a special promo code</strong></span> - People love to feel like they have access to an exclusive deal or special. Brainstorm a neat promotion offer and come up with a code to accompany it. Feature that code on a corresponding photo and upload it to Instagram. Make that filtered photo a consistent part of your campaign targeted to your Instagram followers. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>#3 - Behind the scenes sneak previews</strong></span> - If you're hosting or attending an event, share photos from backstage or during the planning phases. Take your followers along for the ride. Whether you're uploading pics during the actual event or prior to it, you can build suspense and interest over time using Instagram in this way.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>#4 - Post to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest</strong></span> - The neat thing about Instagram is that you can automatically post your photos to Facebook and Twitter. Doing so will help grow your following and extend your overall reach for a particular campaign. Don't feel weird about having duplicated content on multiple sites. You do not have to post to all sites at the same time. In fact, we discourage doing so. If you can make a note to yourself to publish first on Instagram, then a few hours later post it on Facebook and so on and so on. This method of trickling out your message helps you reach more people. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Hopefully, these four steps easy to understand and implement. Instagram really is not a complex social media site to conquer. Even the most boring business or industry can find SOMETHING to photograph. Instagram filters make even the most dull photos look amazing and cool, so give it a shot and see what your followers think. If you get a 'like' or 'retweet,' you'll know you're doing something right. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Happy Instagramming!</div>

      <title>Twitter 'Survey' Feature Currently In Beta Testing; New Profile Pages</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<div></div>
<div>Every day millions of people and brands across the globe are sending tweets from their mobile phones or desktops. That's 400 million tweets a day, to be exact. But the half-life of a tweet is so short that resonating with any audience on the network a daunting task to say the least.</div>
<div></div>
<br><div>The chances of someone taking the time to answer a survey between tweets is slim, but Twitter plans to change that thanks to their new partnership with Nielsen. The purpose of this blog is to give you a heads up on what's to come. </div>
<br><div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The two companies are working together on Twitter's new feature, <span style="color: #800000;"><strong><a href="http://advertising.twitter.com/2012/10/survey-saysnielsen-brand-impact-on.html" title="Twitter Surveys" target="_self"><span style="color: #800000;">Twitter Surveys</span></a></strong></span>, which is currently in beta testing with a small number of advertisers. Set to roll out to more brands in early 2013, here's what Twitter Surveys will look like.</div>
<br><div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Surveys%20CallToAction_1%20(1)-resized-600.png" alt="Surveys CallToAction 1 (1) resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></div>
<div><strong><br></strong></div>
<div></div>
<br><div>Twitter users will see this tweet in both their mobile and desktop apps. The cool factor to Twitter Surveys isn't the survey itself. It's cool because instead of attaching a link to a survey hosted somewhere else, the survey is actually embedded in the tweet. Here's what that will look like.</div>
<div></div>
<br><div><strong><img id="img-1349363973944" src="/Portals/123780/images/fashionweek-resized-600.png" alt="fashionweek resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></strong></div>
<div><strong><br></strong></div>
<div></div>
<br><div>Because this feature is still in beta testing, there are many things left uncertain and questions left unanswered. Which leaves us to speculate about the possible uses and abilities of this feature. So, stay tuned for the official launch in early 2013.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<br><div>Survey's are not the only new feature up Twitter's sleeve. By now you have probably noticed that your <span style="color: #800000;"><strong><a href="http://advertising.twitter.com/2012/09/new-twitter-profile-pages-richer-way-to.html" title="Twitter profile page" target="_self"><span style="color: #800000;">Twitter profile page</span></a></strong></span> looks differently than before. In late September, Twitter rolled out a design enhancement that makes profile pages more eye-catching by allowing users to customize their profile pages with header photos.  </div>

<div></div>
<br><div>Now the profile header photos appears much larger than before. They even enhanced the background image, so that users can display content on the left and right side. Twitter users can switch to the new design by uploading new images. At some point, Twitter will force everyone into this new design, but you're free to stick to the old look for now. </div>

      <title>Google's 3 Must-Have Mobile Site Considerations</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<div>If you've been on the fence about getting a mobile site for your business, Google has released some compelling data that is sure to you over the hump and on the road to a user-friendly mobile site. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<br>In a recent Google survey titled "<a href="http://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/">What Users Want Most From Mobile Sites Today</a>", 67% of mobile users said they're more likely to buy a product or service from a mobile-friendly site, and 74% said they're more likely to return to that site in the future. This isn't something we haven't heard before, but this time Google went so far as to showcase great examples of businesses giving mobile users what they've asked for. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<br>So, what's the big deal with mobile sites anyway? Just in case you've been living under a rock for the past 5 years, most people own smart phones with amazing capabilities including access to the Internet. Consumers search for products and services using their smartphones that have small screens which can only display so much information at a time. It's your job as a marketer or business owner to make sure that your potential and current customers have a seamless, hassle-free mobile site experience. Complicated navigation and text heavy websites are a sure way to deter customers from making purchases using their smartphones.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<br>According to Google, mobile friendly sites have two benefits: active users and returning users. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<br>Google identifies three main assets that mobile-friendly sites must have:</div>
<div><ol>
<li>Quick load times. Anytime over 5 seconds is too long. Mobile users want to visit sites that load fast, because they are searching for information on the go.</li>
<li>Less scrolling, big buttons, and fast search.</li>
<li>Display business information such as phone numbers, directions, and ways to make purchases.</li>
</ol></div>
<div>
<br>Simply put, mobile users need to make purchases on the go. Without this ability, customers are less likely to visit your website via their smartphones. Everyday you go without a mobile site is another day that you are losing business, sales, and turning off potential customers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<br>Google has a free solution for you, it's called <a href="http://howtogomo.com">howtogomo.com</a>. Visit that site and see exactly what your customers see when they visit your website from their mobile phone. </div>
<div></div>

      <title>SEO Rewind Friday – Top SEO Stories Sept. 24 – 28, 2012</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Top%20SEO%20Storis%20Sept.%2024th-resized-600.jpg" alt="Top SEO Storis Sept. 24th resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" border="0">We’ve got some really nice great posts this week.  Luckily many of the articles in this edition tie in really nicely with eachother.  This week you’ll learn link building from one of SEO’s biggest celebrities, visually learn how to perform keyword research, find out how to create killer infographics on a budget, learn everything you need to know about authorship and why it’s so important, finally understand what semantic search his and how you can take advantage of this evolution now, and even more.</p>
<p><a href="http://pointblankseo.com/introducing-link-building-course">Introducing the Point Blank SEO Link Building Course</a></p>
<p>This is not necessarily an educational blog post, but I had to include it nevertheless.  You may or may not have heard of a guy named Jon Cooper.  Jon is an SEO phenom who was just a teenager when he burst onto the SEO scene and made a name for himself as a very talented SEO/link builder.  He just released a new Link Building Course and if you want to improve your link building skills, run don’t walk to get this course.  FYI I have no affiliation with Jon Cooper whatsoever, just a fan.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/infographic-how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-134202">Infographic:  How To Do Keyword Research For SEO</a></p>
<p>Keyword research is generally the initial task when beginning any SEO project.  If you don’t have a process in place it can be extremely overwhelming.  You could end up opening pandora’s box, and spending hours and hours using different tools and wading through search volume, giving yourself a migraine headache in the process.  This infographic does an excellent job explaining a very simplistic process for doing SEO keyword research, so you can save time and energy for the rest of your SEO project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/ugc/how-to-create-an-infographic-for-less-than-500">How To Create An Infographic For Less Than $500</a></p>
<p>You’ve probably noticed infographics are pretty hot right now.  Although Matt Cutts hinted that the infographic links could possibly be devalued in the future, you might as well ride the wave while you can.  This post will show you how to create a great infographic that will generate tons of links on the cheap.  The author explains how to research, design, and promote an infographic for less than $500, which is one hell of a deal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stateofsearch.com/google-authorship-importance/">Authorship:  What and How and Why is it so Important to Google?</a></p>
<p>We are seeing some major developments by Google which indicate a growing importance of Google’s authorship markup.  At this point you might be wondering what the heck is authorship, or how can I implement Google’s authorship markup on my site.  Don’t worry this blog covers all of your questions and even gives you a few strategies to give your authorship more authority.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-confirms-hidden-benefit-of-authorship-134526">Google Confirms Hidden Benefit Of Authorship:  Bonus Links After A Back-Button Click</a></p>
<p>Remember how in the snippet above we said how Google is doing some things that point to the growing importance of Authorship markup?  Well this is a prime example, Google has confirmed that if a user returns to the search results after reading an author-tagged article for a certain period of time, Google will add three additional links to similar articles from the same author, click on the article to see how it looks and learn more about this update. </p>
<p><b>It seems to me that Google is shouting to the heavens that this whole authorship thing is important, so we better start paying attention and laying out strategies on how to best use it.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/semantic-search-what-is-it-how-are-major-search-and-social-engines-use-it-part-1-133160">How Search &amp; Social Engines Are Using Semantic Search</a></p>
<p>This is a very interesting article discussing how Google, Bing, and other search engines are evolving from simple search engines to “answer engines” by using semantic search technology.   Search engines are using the data they have compiled over the years along with new technologies to become smarter and better at generating more relevant results for search queries.  They are also supplying webmasters with tools to assist them in identifying key bits of information to accomplish this goal.  This article talks about the history of semantic search and gives some examples of how the search engines are using it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/ugc/getting-the-most-out-of-schemaorg-microformats">Getting The Most Out of Schema.org Microformats</a></p>
<p>This post is an awesome follow up to the Semantic Search article above.  Schema.org markup is one of the tools for webmasters I discussed above.  <b><a href="http://www.schema.org/">Schema.org</a></b> is an initiative launched on 2 June 2011 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing" title="Bing">Bing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%21" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> to "create and support a common set of schemas for structured data markup on web pages."  This markup can be recognized by search engine spiders to help them understand the meaning of sites and producerich snippets of information in search results.  These rich snippets have been proven to increase CTR and there are SEO murmurs that sites without microformats will soon be left in the dust in the SERP display, so study up on this stuff now.  This article is a great place to start.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/seo-friendly-url-syntax-practices-134218">Understanding SEO Friendly URL Syntax Practices</a></p>
<p>Poor URL structure can impair rankings, keep pages out of search engine indexes, and can drain authority from your entire site.  This post shows you how to audit your URL’s, what to look for, and how to fix URL issues to provide better SEO and usability.</p>
<p>What did we miss?  Let us know if you find any amazing SEO stories out there you’d like to share with our readers.</p>

      <title>5 Lessons SEO's Can Learn From Watching 'Breaking Bad'</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1348755112515" src="/Portals/123780/images/SEO%20lessons%20from%20breaking%20bad-resized-600.jpg" alt="SEO lessons from breaking bad resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" border="0" height="311" width="406">If you haven't been hooked by the 6 time Emmy Award winning <a href="http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad" title="AMC series 'Breaking Bad'" target="_self">AMC series 'Breaking Bad'</a> yet, do yourself a favor and check it out.  It is one of the best shows of all time in my opinion, right up there with 'The Wire' and 'Arrested Development.'</p>
<p>The premiss of the show is centered around a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White, who is diagnosed with stage 4 lung Cancer, and in order to provide for the future of his family in the event he were to pass away, he recruits one of his former students, Jesse Pinkman, to manufacture and distribute crystal meth.  As you can imagine all sorts of tomfoolery ensus, but I don't want to give too much away YET...  WARNING SPOILER ALERTS BELOW!</p>
<p>So being an SEO/inbound marketing consultant, I equate everything with marketing and 'Breaking Bad' is no different, so I started thinking about what this show can teach us about SEO and really marketing in general.  I'd love to hear your input about this, so please tell me if you have anything to add or just want to let me know I'm a complete weirdo.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 1:  Certain Talents and Disciplines Can Translate Well To SEO<br></strong></p>
<p>As I explained above Walter White started his career as a brilliant chemist and later became a high school chemistry teacher.  The knowledge and talent he developed along the way allowed him to start cooking 'Blue Sky' the finest methamphetamine in Albuquerque, a product that makes him a ton of money.</p>
<p>Just like being a chemistry teacher translates well into becoming master chef of the local crystal meth lab, many different job descriptions can become extraordinary SEO's.  For example, PR professionals and programmer/developers. </p>
<p>PR people are especially well suited for SEO.  Their main job description is building relationships with media and nowadays, bloggers, to help spread the word about different brand innitiatives and stories in order to build more interest around that brand. </p>
<p>As SEO's one of our biggest tasks is building links from relevant authoritative sources to increase the ranking and traffic for our clients websites, therefore increasing awareness of their brand.  The way we get those links is by building strong relationships with potential link partners and leveraging their audiences to grow our clients audience.  PR people are extremely skilled at uncovering these potential partners and then building relationships with them making them excellent candiates for SEO professionals.</p>
<p>Programmers can also become awesome SEO's.  They tend to be more analytical by nature, can easily dissect data, spot trends and opportunities, and create solutions that others might not be equipped to do.  Not to mention they are proficient at creating tools to build scalability which is a huge part of SEO.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2: Building The Right Team Can Make Or Break You</strong></p>
<p>In Season 2 of 'Breaking Bad,' Walter's medical bills start to mount up, so he decides it's time to grow the operation.  Jesse, being the one with street cred, sets out to build a team of dealers to help sell the product.  He recruits a few of his methhead friends Badger, Skinny, and Combo.  You can probably tell by the names that they're less Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerburg, Bill Gates and more Larry, Curly, and Mo.  Things go pretty good for a while, until all hell breaks loose, Skinny gets mugged by a couple of tweakers, Combo gets shot by a 12 year old kid, and Badger gets arrested by the skinny kid in Road Trip (you know you're having a bad day when that happens.)</p>
<p>Well Badger's arrest leads Walter and Jesse to seek out legal advice.  Enter Saul Goodman played by the hilarious Bob Odenkirk and one of my favorite characters.  Saul is a slimeball lawyer but a connected slimeball lawyer, and pretty good at his job.  Meet Saul...</p>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wqnHtGgVAUE" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe>
<p> </p>
<p>With Saul's connections, Walter and Jesse are able to build a much more competent partnerships and their business explodes from there.  While the first attempt almost destroyed them and the business, they flourish with their more talented counterparts FOR NOW...</p>
<p>In SEO it's important to <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/07/16/100-lessons-learned-from-10-years-of-seo/" title="build the right team and fire fast" target="_self">build the right team and fire fast</a>. Bad employees hurt the people around them much more than it’ll hurt to let them go.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3: By Leveraging the Right Partnerships You Can Increase Traffic and Sales Dramatically</strong></p>
<p>Seeing the issues that Walter and Jesse have distributing their amazing product, Saul suggests a different strategy and introduces Walter to a new business Partner, Gus Fring.  Gus has distribution channels not only in Albuquerque or New Mexico for that matter, but many of the surrounding states in the Southwest.  Where they were making a few thousand here and there before, Gus offers them $1.2 million for one weekend of cooking, a dramatic increase in revenue through one relationship they built.  I'd say that was worth the effort to find that partner.</p>
<p>Finding a partner like Gus is much like finding the right influencer in your market.  Finding a link partner that already has an established audience that follows his or her every word and then landing guest posts and other linking opportunities can be like hitting the jackpot<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson 4:  There's No Replacement for A Great Product</strong></p>
<p>The major reason Walter and Jesse are able to be so successful, and find business partners like Gus Fring is because Walter created "The Bomb Product Yo." Blue Sky is 99% pure crystal meth, when you have meth that clean people will rob, cheat, or steal to get it.  Not only will they want it, but they'll spread the word virally and become "Brand Advocates" which can be a huge asset.  Once the word gets out demand rises and so do prices helping Walter and Jesse become instant millionaires.</p>
<p>When you are doing SEO for a great product it makes life so much easier.  People will naturally want to talk about it, link to it, and if you find the right audience become your biggest ambassadors helping you spread the word faster and more efficiently without as much effort on your part.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 5:  If You Do Shady Stuff Sooner or Later The Authorities Will Catch You<br></strong></p>
<p>Throughout the first few seasons, Walter White's brother-in-law and DEA agent, Hank Schrader, is investigating the latest unknown drug kingpin, "Heisenburg," Walter's alter ego.  He's getting closer and closer to figuring things out and you can feel the tension building.  I have a sixth sense that he's going to get caught.  The series isn't over yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.  But my guess is it's not going to turn out good.</p>
<p>In the SEO world, Google is our Hank Shrader or DEA agent.  Black hat SEO's much like Walter White know what they're doing isn't in line with Google's guidelines and isn't adding any value to the web but rather polluting it with crap content.  And with each and every algorithm change Google inches closer and closer to shutting all black hat techniques down.  And I think the Panda and Penguin updates mark a huge milestone in that effort.  So the moral of the story is don't deal meth... I mean don't do black hat SEO.  Sorry Black Hats.</p>
<p>So in a nutshell this might be somewhat of a stretch, but I enjoyed writing about it anyway.  Let me know what you think below, agree, disagree, think I'm on crystal meth?  I'd love to hear it.</p>

<p><a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2205803/Bare-Minimum-SEO-3-Things-You-Must-Do">Bare Minimum SEO: 3 Things You Must Do</a></p>
<p>Great article for those small or large businesses just starting out in SEO that don’t necessarily have the time or the budget to go at SEO full steam ahead.  Eric Enge, an SEO I respect greatly, offers the 3 main tasks he focus on if he was in the fore mentioned situation, 1.  Check Indexing Status 2.  Focus on Target Keywords 3. Build links.  To learn what Eric suggests for each of these areas, go checkout the article.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/ugc/using-adwords-data-for-seo-unlocking-the-ultimate-keyword-research-treasure-trove-arrrgh">Using Adwords Data for SEO:  Unlocking the Ultimate Keyword Research Treasure Trove (Arrrgh!!)</a></p>
<p>This is one of the best explanations I’ve read on how to utilize Adwords Campaign data for SEO keyword research.  This method of keyword research is way more effective than using any free or paid keyword analysis tools because it’s actual real performance data as it applies to YOUR website.  The data you can mine from your Adwords campaign can help you find the keywords that are already generating conversions, show you which ads are generating hi click through rates so you can either create similar content or use them in your meta tags,  help you analyze keyword difficulty which is usually proportional to Cost Per Click, and lots more.  This is an AWESOME post, Read it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rimmkaufman.com/blog/how-to-create-a-link-building-strategy/20092012/">How To Create A Link Building Strategy</a></p>
<p>This is a solid article.  Link Building is one of the hardest and most important tasks in SEO.  There are tons of blog posts and videos out there explaining how to do it and all the different strategies, so many it can get quite overwhelming.   One thing that a lot of those articles lack is what type of link building strategies are appropriate or needed to outrank YOUR competition.  Rather than undertaking a lot of linking strategies that will get you nowhere, this article will show you a quick and dirty way to analyze your TRUE SEO competitors to give you real data on which to base your link building strategies.</p>
<p><a href="http://skyrocketseo.co.uk/video-how-to-evaluate-guest-post-opportunities-featuring-live-site-reviews/">Video: How to Evaluate Guest Post Opportunities (Featuring Live Site Reviews)</a></p>
<p>Guest Posting has increased in popularity since the roll out of Penguin.  Hi quality links are more important than ever.  Low value guest posting is just a slight step up from article submissions, a tactic most likely penalized by penguin.  So best practice would be to evaluate the opportunities and only target the best ones based on metrics, relevance, and site quality.  This video will show you how.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2205821/Algorithm-Updates-Duplicate-Content-A-Recovery">Algorithm Updates, Duplicate Content &amp; A Recovery</a></p>
<p>Here’s another post detailing a website getting slammed by one of Google’s algorithm, analyzing the issues of the site, taking an action, and recovering.  You may be getting tired of these posts, but I love them because they’re all unique in the issues facing each of them, the analysis they went through, and the steps they take to recover.  I think SEO’s can learn a lot from these types of articles, so give it a read.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.swellpath.com/2012/09/author-rich-snippets-for-youtube-video-content/">Author Rich Snippets for YouTube Video Content</a></p>
<p>Rich snippets, in case you don’t know, are the few lines of text (and images) that appear alongside search results to give users additional information about what is on the page and why it is relevant to their query.  If you’ve looked for informational type queries on Google, you’ve most likely seen pictures of the authors of blog posts next to their results.  These are Author rich snippets generated by <a href="https://plus.google.com/authorship">attaching a Google + profile to content via authorship</a>.  Well now you can not only apply this to text based content, but also YouTube videos.  This blog post is your guide to making it happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-announces-news-keywords-metatag-133759">Back To The Future:  Google Announces A Meta Keywords Tag Just for News Articles</a></p>
<p>Google just announced the ability to use a new news_keywords metatag for news publishers who are sources for Google news.  Basically this tag gives publishers more creative reign with their headlines and copy so they don’t have to scramble to fit keywords in everything they publish, while still getting credit for the keywords that apply to the article.  If you publish press releases via PRWeb, PRNewswire, or any other services that publish to Google News make sure and read this post and grab the new keywords metatag.</p>

      <title>How to Plan Your Week on Social Media </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Creating a content marketing plan that works on social media is more complex than it seems. In order for a content marketing plan to truly resonate with your fans/followers and spark interaction, you must have two main ingredients: a 5-day action plan and endurance to see it through. Really, that’s all you need.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/social-media-bandwagon-resized-600.jpeg" alt="social media bandwagon resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" border="0">In this blog, we will give you a simple to implement content marketing plan that will give your social media presence the consistency and variety it needs to thrive. The endurance to see it through every week is something you must bring to the table.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple 5-day content marketing plan for local business social media sites:</p>
<ol><ol>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">MONDAY</span> - Feature a <span style="color: #800000;"><b>special promotion</b></span> that is only redeemable if you share the ‘secret code’ at checkout. Remember to offer a discount that holds actual value. Not a 10 percent off deal. Make it 20, 30, or even 50 percent to really get the your fans/followers motivated to redeem it.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">TUESDAY</span> – Offer <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Tidbits</b></span> are a great way to provide tips and tricks about a particular topic relating to your business specifically or your industry overall. With the prevalence of Google Search and the information age, consumers are accustomed to researching the ins and outs of everything from ‘Asian inspired recipes’ to the ‘health benefits of eating mango’. By creating a consistent stream of posts that seek to educate or shed light on an unknown topic, your following will come to view you as a source of information. Over time, you should see more comments and questions rolling in.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">WEDNESDAY </span>- <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Behind the Scenes</b></span> posts offer your customers a peek into the internal workings of your company. You can choose to feature video or photos, either one will work fine. Make sure that whatever you decide to feature is well photographed or produced. People are not keen on ‘liking’ or retweeting footage of poor quality.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">THURSDAY</span> – <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Local Spotlights </b></span>take the focus off your business and employees and place it back on the community. Identify complimentary (not competing) businesses and give them a shout out on your social media site. Be sure to directly mention them, so they are aware of what you’re doing. This is simply an act of goodwill that will help extend your reach beyond the people who have already liked or followed your page.  </li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">FRIDAY </span>– <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Employee Features </b></span>are a good way to close the week on a positive note and bring the attention back to your business. Post pictures of your employees at work. Your employees are the first line of defense for your company and who your customers recognize as part of your brand.</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>Social media does not have to be a time-consuming task. In fact, you can plan your week ahead of time and schedule all your posts, which will leave even more time for you to focus your attention on other marketing efforts. We recommend running this schedule for a full month before deciding to make changes to it. Give your following some time to pick up on the routine. Consistent content gives them something to look forward to and a definite avenue to interact with your businesses social media presence.</p>

      <title>Twitter Releases Interest Targeting Tool for Marketers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Up until now, advertising on Twitter has been an exercise in futility for the majority of marketers and business owners out there. Thankfully, Twitter launched a new targeting tool for promoted tweets. This feature allows advertisers to promote their products and services to users who indicated interest in certain topics, as well as target users by username. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Interest Targeting</strong></span></p>
<p>Twitter determines what users are interested in by analyzing their tweets to see what they are talking about, who they follow, and most importantly what keywords they use. With this <a href="https://business.twitter.com/advertise/analytics/">new tool</a>, ads are sorted by different categories of interest. There are more than 350 interest categories to choose from, according to a Twitter blog on interest targeting. Once your ad is sorted into the appropriate categories and tagged under a specific topic, any user that expressed interest in that topic will see your ad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/interest%20targeting-resized-600.png" alt="interest targeting resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p><img id="img-1347286271163" src="/Portals/123780/images/ptweets-dashboard-resized-600.png" alt="ptweets dashboard resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0">For example, if you own a “Pet Grooming Shop” and created an ad under that category, everyone who indicated an interest in “pets" will see your ad.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Username Targeting</span></strong></p>
<p>Twitter's approach to username targeting is not what you may think at first glance. You cannot setup your promoted tweet ads to target specific users that follow another username. What Twitter does is find similar profiles to the one you select to target with ads. For example, if you want to users who enjoy music to see your promoted tweet, you should select @MTV. Twitter will not show your ad to everyone who follows @MTV, instead they will show it to users who have shown an interest in music based on their tweets. Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Other Twitter Tools:</span></strong></p>
<p>While advertising is one way to find your audience on Twitter, there are a number of free tools available to fill in the gaps. Some tools are intuitive, like Twitter Search, while others require more set-up, strategy, and management.</p>
<p>Gaining quality followers isn’t a science but it takes a considerable amount of time and effort. Here’s a list of a few tools that can help you get started on the right path. I do not recommend using every tool at the same time. Instead take time to test them individually or two that do different things. Don’t go overboard, it’ll ruin your test. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b><a href="http://www.filtertweeps.com/#!%7B%22search%22:%7B%7D%7D"><span style="color: #800000;">Filtertweeps</span></a> </b></span>allows you to identify potential followers by filtering based on different values such as: keywords in bio, keywords in location, number of followers/following, account age, follower/following ratio, custom avatar, verified user, languages, etc. With so many ways to filter your search, it’s easy to find and ultimately target potential customers.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://www.twellow.com/"><span style="color: #800000;">Twellow</span></a></span>, <span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://wefollow.com/"><span style="color: #800000;">We Follow</span></a></span>, </b>and<b> <span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://listorious.com/"><span style="color: #800000;">Listorious</span></a> </span></b>are directories of public Twitter accounts that allow you to find people based on a specific topic or interest. Type in a keyword and you can pull up lists of people that belong to a specific group of category of interest.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b><a href="http://www.buzzom.com/tag/tweetbeep/"><span style="color: #800000;">TweetBeep</span></a> </b></span>send you an email when the keywords you identify are mentioned on Twitter. Pretty neat, huh? If you’re familiar with Google Alerts at all, it’s sort of the same thing except it monitors keywords from Twitter instead of the entire the Internet. This is a great tool to discover new people to follow. Undoubtedly, you’ll get notified of spam and bot accounts, so test different keyword combinations until you find the right ones.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that other social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn are good ways to build your audience on Twitter. Integrate Twitter promotion into posts on other sites and you’ll have a good chance of getting followers to migrate over. As Twitter continues to explore ways to increase it’s value as a communication tool, there will undoubtedly be more opportunities to improve targeted audience development.</p>

      <title>Facebook Rolls Out Search Ads for Major Advertisers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>While their IPO continues to drop and rumors mount about CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s next move, Facebook’s latest attempt to up the advertising anty comes in the form of paid search ads. Facebook advertising got a lot of flack for lack of ROI and usage since the company began publicly trading. </p>
<p>Last week, Facebook officially launched it’s own version of PPC ads called <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Sponsored Results</b>.</span> While it’s highly doubtful that Sponsored Results will give Google AdWords a run for its money, this has potential to be a good Facebook advertising test once the feature is made readily available to the masses. Right now, only major advertisers like Match.com and Zynga are able to access this feature.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll explain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How it Works and Appears on Facebook</li>
<li>API Documentation</li>
<li>The likelihood of a Facebook PPC vs. Google AdWords Faceoff</li>
<li>How to Prepare for the Full Launch</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>How it All Works and Appears on Facebook</b></span></p>
<p>When you go to the search box on Facebook and type in keywords, you will see a drop down listing of organic and paid advertisements that looks something like this…</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/facebook-sponsored-results-zynga.png" alt="facebook sponsored results zynga" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>Facebook’s paid search results are identified as such in the bold typeface above the search result. Prior to last Wednesday, this result was nonexistent. Once clicked, the paid ad leads users to either an official page, app, or place. The ad will NOT route the user offsite.</p>
<p>Here’s what Facebook had to say in a private message to marketers that we found on HubSpot’s blog:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Sponsored Results gives brands the ability to buy ads in search results, bringing more awareness and traffic to your App, Page, or Place. Sponsored Results give you:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>1. Expanded distribution of your message, with placement in one of the most used features on Facebook.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>2. The ability to target what people are looking for, by appearing alongside related Apps, Pages, and Places.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3. Flexibility to customize your landing destination, such as a specific tab on your Page.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Brands are not able to drive offsite using this product, but you will have the ability to drive to specific Pages, Tabs, and Canvas Applications.</em></p>
<p>This message doesn’t include what’s probably the most intriguing point of this new feature. Sponsored Results can appear ABOVE organic results. The example below shows how a search for ‘OKCupid’ a dating site triggers a Sponsored Result ad for Match.com’s app above any mention of OKCupid.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/facebook-sponsored-search-results-first-resized-600.png" alt="facebook sponsored search results first resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p>Stealing search traffic in this way has some potential to drive traffic to Facebook pages, apps, and places. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>API Documentation</b></span></p>
<p>Something else to look forward to is the integration of Sponsored Results with Power Editor. In a recent ‘Platform Update,’ Facebook announced plans to do just that.</p>
<p><img id="img-1346078235784" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-08-27%20at%2010.14.34%20AM.png" alt="Facebook API" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>The likelihood of a Facebook PPC vs. Google AdWords Faceoff</b></span></p>
<p>The main reason I find it hard to get truly excited about Sponsored Results is the lack of success I’ve experienced firsthand with Facebook’s advertising tools AND the prevalence of Google AdWords.</p>
<p>There is a great sense among industry leaders and marketers that Facebook is grasping at straws to keep it’s IPO from completely bottoming out. Zuckerberg recently commented on the situation. While optimism seems to still live on at Facebook, the rest of us aren’t so sure this boat isn’t sinking.</p>
<p>The other source of doubt in Sponsored Results is the immense popularity and high usage rates of Google AdWords. The war between Google and Facebook continues to blaze on and right now Google is the clear winner. The fact that Facebook search results do not appear in Google Search results is obviously hurting the virality of Facebook pages, apps, and places.</p>
<p>Google’s SEO prowess and forethought has made it the go-to resource for online search and local marketing. They’re reporting <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-search-press-129925">100 billion searches per month</a>. Just think about it, when you’re looking for a directions, menus, and reviews for that new Italian restaurant around the corner, your first instinct is to go to Google Search or your Google Search App. NOT Facebook search.</p>
<p>Facebook search is typically used to find official Facebook pages and people that you are already familiar with. It’s highly unlikely that Sponsored Results will surpass Google AdWords any time in the near future or at all.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>How to Prepare for the Full Launch of Sponsored Results</b></span></p>
<p>Since Sponsored Results are only available to a limited audience at the moment, the rest of us have some time to map out a plan of action.</p>
<p>First off, decide if your paid ad will take people to your app, page or place. If you’re a restaurant, a page or place is a better option because business information like hours of operation, phone number, customer recommendations, etc. are readily available. If you have an app that has a competitor, link your paid ad to that under common search queries for you competitor, similar to the Match.com example above. It’s a pretty neat way to steal your opponent’s traffic and possibly convert their customers.</p>
<p>If you have a tab that links to your website, test a paid ad out here as well. Right now, Sponsored Ads cannot link to outside websites, but Facebook hasn’t stated anything about linking to a tab that links out to your site. It’s worth a try.</p>
<p>Facebook has us all waiting in the wings until this feature rolls out to the masses. We’ll keep you posted. Stay tuned for more social media updates.</p>

      <title>How to Boost Your Social, Local, Mobile Marketing Presence TODAY</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Yet another fancy marketing term has emerged on the scene in recent months.  <img id="img-1345474404932" src="/Portals/123780/images/solomo-resized-600.png" alt="tips for boosting your solomo, your social, local, mobile presence" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" height="439" width="265" border="0"></p>
<p>SoLoMo – short for social, local, and mobile – refers to the growing trend of targeting consumers based on their location through mobile devices and social networks. The concept of SoLoMo gained some valuable mileage over the past few months due to a recent report released by <a href="www.localeze.com." title="Localeze" target="_self">Localeze</a> (a trusted business listings identity management provider for local search) and <a href="http://www.15miles.com" title="15miles" target="_self">15miles</a> (a leader in local, mobile, and social marketing solutions).   </p>
<p>According to the <em>Local Search Usage Study</em> findings, online business listings are a worthy investment for local businesses.</p>
<p>Localeze/15miles administered an online survey to 4,000 consumers to find out their mobile and tablet local search usage. The study provides insightful data about how online listings are increasingly becoming a source of trusted local business information.<b> </b></p>
<p>The findings of that study note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tablet owners are the most active local searchers.</li>
<li>Tablets themselves are critical assets throughout all stages of the local business search and purchase cycle.</li>
<li>86 percent of respondents make a purchase form their most recent tablet-based local search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this is great news for businesses that hopped on the tablet and mobile bandwagon early. But it’s not enough to simply have a tablet friendly version of your business website. The implications these findings hold for the potential return for investing time and resources into populating business listings is enough to make the case for doing so expeditiously.</p>
<p>Simply put, online business listings are one more way to drive traffic to your website AND capture local customers who have immediate intention of purchasing.  </p>
<p>If you’re still having trouble drawing your own conclusions about the value of these findings, keep reading. We’ve got a few actionable thoughts below. </p>

<p>Fully completed business listings on the major local directories are definitely a good idea considering these recent data findings. If consumers are searching online for fast information, you should make sure yours is accurate and up-to-date.  Google + Local, Bing Local, and Yahoo Local are a good starting place.  Here is a list of the top places to list your business by <a href="http://getlisted.org/resources/local-citations-by-city.aspx" title="city" target="_self">city</a> and by <a href="http://getlisted.org/resources/local-citations-by-category.aspx" title="business category" target="_self">business category</a>.</p>
<span style="color: #993300;"><b>2.    </b><b>Optimize Your Website for Tablets and Mobile Devices</b></span><br><ol></ol>
<p>Consumers are searching for businesses online using tablets and smartphones. This means your website should be optimized for tablet and mobile screen sizes. It’s a worthy investment and if you’re serious about taking advantage of the SoLoMo revolution, you’ll be willing to make this investment.</p>
<span style="color: #993300;"><b>3.    </b><b>Create Backlinks on Social Profiles</b></span><br><ol></ol>
<p>Social media is not just a fad. The purpose of social media in online marketing is to funnel customers and potential customers back to your business website. By dropping links to your content on Twitter and Facebook, you increase your chances of making a seamless transition from a social setting to making an actual sale online.</p>
<p>Here's a cool <a href="http://pinterest.com/kikilitalien/solomo/" title="Pinterest board" target="_self">Pinterest board</a> of SoLoMo infographics that do a great job of explaining the concept visually. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SoLoMo Tools for Businesses &amp; Marketers: </span></p>
<p>When it comes to social, local, and mobile tools, there are more than enough variety and options to go around. Tools like Yelp, Foursquare, Google+, Living Social, and Groupon are already highly successful and pretty much your go-to resources. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are a few not-so-familiar SoLoMo tools:</span></p>
<p><strong>ThinkNear</strong></p>
<p><em>"At ThinkNear, we help advertisers reach consumers based on where they are, what they are doing, and what is happening around them. We call it "Situational Targeting" and it allows advertisers to talk to consumers while taking into account their real world interactions.</em></p>
<p><em>Situational Targeting is not just great for advertisers, but more importantly, it ensures that consumers see ads relevant to what they are doing and thinking. This leads to some amazing results, like 4x industry average CTRs and through the roof conversions."</em></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>GoMo </strong></p>
<p><em>"When users aren’t accessing the Internet on their desktops, they’re on mobile devices and tablets. If you are not mobilized, your users could be consuming content from other sites, even possibly a competitor. Having a mobile-optimized website gives your users the ability to connect with you wherever they are, on whatever device. This provides users consistent experiences across devices and keeps them coming back."</em><strong><br></strong></p>
<iframe id="img-1345477008188" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ja7abx3OPOQ" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe>
<p><strong>AppeAR  </strong></p>
<p><em>"The AppeAR platform transforms 3D models into interactive objects that come to life on mobile devices. AppeAR leverages keystone images, called “trackables”, which are encoded as a series of points. These images can be printed on paper, clothing, or viewed electronically from a website. When the device’s camera is focused on the trackable image from any angle, the AppeAR library recognizes the image and executes the associated augmented reality experiences."</em><strong><br></strong></p>

	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Top%20seo%20stories%20august%2020%20-%2024.gif" alt="Top seo stories august 20   24" class="alignRight" style="float: right;" border="0">We found some really great posts for you this week, and a good mix too. Check out this issue to find the latest SEO industry statistics, learn an awesome local SEO strategy for dominating your local competitors, learn how to build your first 500 links, get some link building ideas you may have never thought of, find out what the big buzz around Semantic SEO is about and how to get started, read some of the big SEO stories we missed this month, and lots more...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/seo-industry-survey">2012 SEO Industry Survey</a></p>
<p>SEOmoz released the results from their biennial SEO and internet marketing industry survey this week.   Pretty interesting read whether you’re in the industry or not, but we had to add it to the mix since it only comes around every two years.  Some of the data you might find informative are top tools used by SEO’s by category and price, how most SEO’s get their training and education, and average salaries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/catching-up-with-your-local-competitors-automating-citation-discovery">Catching Up With Your Local Competitors &amp; Automating Citation Discovery</a></p>
<p>If you’re doing local SEO aka Google Places optimization aka Google + local optimization then this is an absolute must read.  This article describes a simple straight forward tactic for finding all of your competitor’s citations so you can rank higher in local results.  Not only does the post show you how to find what citations your competitors have now, but also track the citations they acquire next month and the month after, so that you know what you need to do in order to out hustle them.</p>
<p><a href="http://moz.com/rand/the-first-500-links/">The First 500 Links</a></p>
<p>This is a nice short post from Rand Fishkin’s blog.  The point he is trying to make is that “if the first 500 links that point to your site aren’t authentically earned, you’re screwed.”   Simply put, if you’re acquiring manipulative links in your first few hundred, it puts your website at much higher risk of getting your hand slapped and your site “sandboxed” by algo updates like Penguin.  He also gives a nice visual link scale to show which strategies are safe to use for the first 500 links to a new website. It’s a quick read and well worth it.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/50-things-every-link-builder-needs-to-know-129580">50 + Things Every Link Builder Needs To Know</a></p>
<p>Link Building is a hard and tedious process.  A lot of marketing agencies like to outsource this aspect of SEO because link building alone can be a full time job.  There are tons of people online promoting themselves as link builders, and people are desperate for help.  But before you go out and hire an “expert,” make sure they know most of the points in this list or you could end up with a bunch of spam links that you have to pay twice as much to have it removed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzstream.com/blog/high-quality-link-building-tactics.html">10 High Quality Link Building Tactics</a></p>
<p>This post contains some excellent link building ideas, several of which I haven’t heard before.  These tactics include some creative ways for grabbing easy .edu links which we all could use.  One of my favorite tactics mentioned is to launch a Startup Competition or Event.  These types of events get a lot of publicity and media buzz the weeks leading up to the event grabbing your site a lot of great incoming links.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/e-comm-websites-step-up-your-q4-content-game-and-build-links-too">E-Comm Websites:  Step Up Your Q4 Content Game (and Build Links, too!)</a></p>
<p>You can always rely on the guys over at Seer Interactive to push out great content, and this post is no different.  The tactics described in this post would work great for E-commerce sites and really any type site I can think of.  Ryan Fontana explains how to identify which keywords have been most profitable for your site.  Then he shows you how to create killer content around those keywords that will not only help with rankings and traffic, but also earn you revenue and build links at the same time.  Great job Ryan.</p>
<p><a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2012/08/search-queries-alerts-in-webmaster-tools.html">Search Queries Alerts In Webmaster Tools</a></p>
<p>This was an announcement made on Google’s Webmaster Central Blog Monday afternoon.  It basically states that whenever sudden spikes or drops in traffic to a websites top pages occur, whether it be due to falling demand of a product, technical issues that need to be resolved, or whatever the case may be, webmasters will now receive notifications in their Google Webmaster Tools account.  This will be extremely helpful as it can be difficult to constantly monitor the health of a site.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2199934/Getting-Started-With-Semantic-SEO">Getting Started With Semantic SEO</a></p>
<p>There’s been a lot of buzz in the SEO community around Google’s semantic search, or the use of artificial intelligence in order to understand search intent and the meaning of a query.  This is huge topic and will change the way we do SEO.  Semantic SEO refers to structuring your website to help search engines better understand the semantic nature of your content.  This post shares a list of different resources and tools to help you educate yourself and get started with Semantic SEO.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/serp-crowding-shrinkage-its-not-your-imagination">SERP Crowding &amp; Shrinkage:  It’s Not Your Imagination</a></p>
<p>Recently there has been an uptick in chatter of people reporting only 7 vs. 10 results on some SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).  This uptick seems to coincide with the appearance of expanded site-links, or additional listings for the same domain that lead further within a particular site beyond the main listing shown for that site.  These results also seem to be more prevalent on, but not exclusive to branded SERPs.  In this article, Dr. Pete does a great job explaining this phenomenon and what it might mean for your business.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stateofsearch.com/the-best-shared-on-twitter-this-month-imho/">Gianluca Forelli’s Super Search Update</a></p>
<p>Want to read the big SEO stories that we missed?  Here’s a curated list of Gianluca Fiorelli’s favorite SEO stories from August 1<sup>st</sup> – August 18<sup>th</sup>.  It looks like we definitely let some great SEO posts slip through the cracks.  There’s also some pretty cool Twitter tips and tricks included.</p>

      <title>Google+ Pages and Profiles Upgraded With Custom URLs</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Google+ finally decided to roll out make the change that will undoubtedly delight marketers everywhere - custom URLs for pages and profiles. This is a first step in a more branded direction for the one-year old social network.<img id="img-1345471835664" src="/Portals/123780/images/Google--Logo-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="describe the image" width="225" height="217" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></p>
<p>While we all knew this was inevitability, the reality of no longer having to deal with the awkward, ugly URLs (<a href="https://plus.google.com/110463090892012135729/posts">https://plus.google.com/110463090892012135729/posts</a>) is welcomed nonetheless.</p>
<p>The news broke on the profile of Google employee Saurabh Sharma on August 13.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Limited Number of Verified Profiles and Pages</b></span></p>
<p>Although this is welcome news, the change won’t take effect for all Google+ users right away. In the official announcement, Sharma stated the following: “At first, we’re introducing custom URLs to a limited number of verified profiles and pages. But over time we plan to offer custom URLs to many more brands and individuals, so please stay tuned!”  </p>
<p>Big brand names such as Hugo Boss(<a class="ot-anchor" href="http://google.com/+hugoboss" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">google.com/+hugoboss</a><span>)</span>, David Beckham(<a class="ot-anchor" href="http://google.com/+davidbeckham" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">google.com/+davidbeckham</a>), Toyota(<a class="ot-anchor" href="http://google.com/+toyota" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">google.com/+toyota</a>), and Delta Airlines (<a class="ot-anchor" href="http://google.com/+delta" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">google.com/+delta</a>) already received the Google+ update. Comments from Google+ users run the gamut of excited about the update to angry that there’s a delay for the little guys.</p>
<p>It’s here that we noticed some Google+ users are confused on how to become a verified Google+ profile or page.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>How to verify your Google+ page</b> </span></p>
<p>Before you can even get in line for a Google+ custom URL, you need to have a verified page. Google+ allows business and organizations to verify pages by completing a simple request form. Verified profiles and pages are noted by a verification badge that looks like this <img src="/Portals/123780/images/verification%20badge.gif" border="0" alt="verification badge">.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Step 1:</strong></span> Complete the online verification request form.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Step 2:</strong></span> Wait for your postcard in the mail.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Step 3:</strong></span> Enter your verification code on your Google+ page. </p>
<p>It’s that simple.</p>
<p>The only thing left to do is join the rest of us in waiting for Google+ to offer custom URLs to more users. </p>

      <title>New 2012 Data: Social, Local, Mobile Search Trend On the Rise</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The explosion of social, local, and mobile platforms and devices is the driving force that motivates consumers to search online for products, services and the business that provide them. You can see them almost anywhere (despite current laws) with their eyes glued to a screen in search of business product reviews, discounts and deals, and the quickest route to get there.</p>
<p>It’s the same force that drives our desire for fast information. The days of thumbing through the Yellow Pages or calling the operator are no more. The SoLoMo revolution has caused consumers to adopt new devices and methods to find local business information.</p>
<p><img id="img-1344958323469" src="/Portals/123780/images/tablets-resized-600.jpeg" alt="local, mobile, and social search using tablets and smartphones on the rise" height="192" width="341" border="0"></p>
<p>Searching for information on-the-go using social, local, and mobile technology backed by smart phone and tablet devices is not only commonplace, it’s natural.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120229005129/en/Localeze15miles-Annual-comScore-Local-Search-Usage-Study" title="Newly released survey data" target="_self">Newly released survey data</a> from 4,000 online surveys proves this rather obvious nature to be true. This is very welcome confirmation for marketers and business owners everywhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.localeze.com/" title="Localeze" target="_self">Localeze</a>, a business listings identity management provider for local search, and <a href="http://www.15miles.com/" title="15 miles" target="_self">15 miles</a>, a leader in SoLoMo marketing solutions, shared their findings during a special joint SMX West presentation. </p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>What’s Driving Local Search and Buying Power?</b></span></p>
<p>The study shows that tablet users are the most active local searchers. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sixty-four (64) percent of tablet users use the devices for local search on a weekly basis</span>.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eighty-six (86) percent of tablet users make purchases</span></em> using information found from their tablet-based local search.</p>
<p><b><em>As for smartphone users…</em></b></p>
<p>The need for fast information is the primary reason <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">61 percent of surveyed consumers used smartphones to conduct local searches</span></em>. Not only that, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>49 percent of consumers who used tablets and mobile devices said they accessed local search information through apps</em></span>.</p>
<p><b><em>But which apps are consumers using? Are more consumers conducting local-app based searches than local-web based?</em></b></p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://searchengineland.com/study-suggests-50-percent-local-search-happening-in-apps-113283" title="Search Engine Land blog" target="_self">Search Engine Land blog</a>, the surveyed consumers had to select from a list of predetermined set of app choices, so not all options were considered. See the findings below.</p>
<img id="img-1344958117790" src="/Portals/123780/images/local%20app%20based%20searches-resized-600.png" alt="local app based search" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"><p><strong><em>Source: comScore, Localeze, 15 Miles</em></strong></p>
<p>Google Maps, Yahoo, and Mapquest are the top three apps used for local business searches conducted on smart phones and tablets. What’s especially interesting is how far down the list Yelp and Urban Spoon landed. The very nature of these sites are designed on the SoLoMo philosophy, so it would be a reasonable guess that they would receive higher usage. That’s just not so.</p>
<p>Daily deals and online couponing are said to be on the decline by some, but businesses continue to see success with these tools. According to this year’s findings, 86 percent of those surveyed said they have or will purchase deals from Groupon or Living Social. </p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Trustworthy Search and Relevant Search Results Matter</b></span></p>
<p>This study shows that <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">61 percent of online searchers consider local search results to be more relevant and 58 percent consider local search results to be more trustworthy than paid or general results</span>.</em> In fact, when searching for local businesses using a mobile device, the most vital data is surprisingly the business name, address, and phone number.</p>
<p>The implications for local search on social networking sites is just as promising. The survey shows that <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">63 percent of those on social networks are more likely to use a business if they have information on a social networking site</span></em>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Conclusions Drawn</b></span></p>
<p>Despite speculation about the ROI of social, local, and mobile marketing campaigns, the data clearly shows that consumers are actively using mobile devices to search for local business information. The facts are clear: business listings have value, mobile apps have value, social networking sites have value, online deals/coupons have value, online reviews have value.</p>
<p>It’s up to you as a business owner or marketer to capitalize on the facts. <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com" title="SearchDog Marketing" target="_self">SearchDog Marketing</a> is here to help guide your way. </p>

      <title>How Auto-Publishing Blogs Increases Lead Generation</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Even the most novice inbound marketer knows that blogging is a sure way to generate leads online. What you may not know is something Hubspot discovered from a recent analysis of their customers – companies that publish blog posts to social media get 50% more leads than companies that don’t.</p>
<p>While that's great news, it does raise questions about exactly how these companies balanced auto-publishing with the rest of their social media content. Auto-publishing is a proven method of generating a substantial amount of more leads, but it's important not to let auto-publishing overwhelm your overall social media strategy. </p>
<p>In this blog, we'll present Hubspot's findings, four auto-publishing tools, and discuss a few best practices for integrating auto-publishing into your lead generation strategy. </p>
<p>Hubspot's findings represent an analysis of 8,892 B2B and B2C businesses. Check out the chart below which details the effectiveness of social media scheduling. </p>
<p><img id="img-1343396372020" src="/Portals/123780/images/social-media-scheduling-leads-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="hubspot data 2" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In an analysis of 3,308 B2B and B2C businesses, Hubspot found that companies who use auto-publishing tools to schedule their social media posts have <strong>3 times as many leads as those that don’t. </strong></p>
<img id="img-1343315558716" src="/Portals/123780/images/blog-auto-publish-lead-generation-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="hubspot data" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><p>While this data leaves many questions unanswered, the marketing takeaway is crystal clear. What everyone has been telling you about developing a content marketing strategy is CORRECT. This aspect of your content cycle is your last step, but shouldn’t be discounted as unimportant to the overall campaign. </p>
<p>Now that you know auto-publishing is the way to go, you must decide which auto-publishing tools work best for you and your social media sites. We’ll provide you a breakdown of sites that are great for auto-publishing your blog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b><a href="http://www.hootsuite.com" title="Hootsuite" target="_self"><span style="color: #800000;">Hootsuite</span></a> </b></span></p>
<p><b> <img id="img-1343315220185" src="/Portals/123780/images/hootsuite-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="hootsuite auto-publishing tool" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></b></p>

<p><img id="img-1343396873296" src="/Portals/123780/images/awareness-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="awareness auto-publishing tool" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Before you start scheduling posts, you should be aware of the pros and cons of auto-publishing on social media. Even though Hubspot is reporting a 50% advantage, it's important to know some best practices for auto-publishing and potential cons of allowing this tactic to overweigh your other posts.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Pros of Auto-Publishing</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Saves Time:</strong> A more obvious benefit of auto-publishing is the time it saves, which allows you to make effective use of your work day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistent Posts: W</strong>ith so many things to do on your marketing checklist, it can be a hassle to keep up with it all AND publish individually on every social media site you have. Auto-publishing allows you to post on a regular basis with little effort. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Cons of Auto-Publishing</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><span>Less Interaction: </span></strong><span>It's an obvious given that the more social media posts you schedule to release automatically, the less you'll post live. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bot-Like Behavior: </strong>If all your social media posts are scheduled, your fans or followers will be able to tell. The downside of auto-publishing is that it looks as if a bot is controlling your page and this is not a good image to project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Marketing Takeaway</strong></span></p>
<p>As you adopt auto-publishing your blog posts as a lead generation tactic, remember not to let it overwhelm your overall social media strategy. Auto-publishing saves time and keeps your social media presence up-to-date, but if not used sparringly it can negatively impact your presence. </p>

      <title>SEO Rewind Friday – Top SEO Stories for July 30 - August 3, 2012</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1344005259590" src="/Portals/123780/images/top%20SEO%20stories-resized-600.PNG" border="0" alt="top SEO stories" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">This week started out pretty quiet in the SEO community we follow.  My theory is that this is partly due to an industry hangover from MozCon 2012, which from the sounds of it was an amazing conference.   Even though the week started out slow, the stars aligned and what we found ended up being an excellent guide to launching any SEO campaign, so without further ado…</p>
<p><a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2196496/How-to-Conduct-an-On-Page-SEO-Site-Audit">How To Conduct an On-Page Site Audit</a></p>
<p>There are three steps that should be taken when starting any SEO campaign are:</p>
<ol>
<li>On-page SEO audit</li>
<li>Technical Site audit</li>
<li>Link audit</li>
</ol>
<p>This article focuses on the first step in launching an SEO campaign, the on-page site audit.  The writer teaches  you how to do a quick top level on-page audit from meta tags, to duplicate title tags, to keyword mapping and cannibalization.  Next week the second part of this series focusing on the technical site audit comes out, so we’ll be sure to include it in our next issue.  But lucky you, we’ve got some excellent articles in this issue that cover the link audit, so keep readingJ</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/15-tips-to-speed-up-your-website">15 Tips to Speed Up Your Website</a></p>
<p>As we all know, site speed is a one of the many factors that search engines look at when determining where to rank sites.  A fast site improves the overall site quality and improves user experience.  Here are 15 tips and tricks that can help you decrease the load time on your websites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stateofsearch.com/understanding-link-profile-1/">Understanding Your Link Profile – Part One</a></p>
<p>We cheated a little bit on this one.  This article was actually from last month, but the article below popped onto our radar and they’re such awesome posts we had to share. </p>
<p>Before starting any link building project you really need to understand your websites link profile and what’s going on behind the scenes so that you can make informed decisions based on real information instead of just throwing something against the wall to see if it sticks.  This article shows you how to gather your link data and using excel, analyze that data to understand the overall strength of your link profile, determine whether your links are live or dead, and make informed decisions on which if any links should be removed.  This is a must read for anyone starting a link building campaign.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stateofsearch.com/understanding-your-link-profile-part-two">Understanding Your Link Profile – Part Two</a></p>
<p>Part 2 of the “Understanding Your Link Profile” series takes a little deeper into our link profile analysis.  In this post Jon Quinton shows us how to use excel and our link data to find site-wide links, categorize our anchor text to spot “Over Cooked” exact match anchor text, and help us uncover links from blog networks.  All of which seem to be big issues with the Penguin Update, so this is great information for sites that might have been hit.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/what-everyone-needs-to-know-about-good-bad-bland-links-129186">What Everyone Needs To Know About Good, Bad, and Bland Links</a></p>
<p>This post breaks down todays popular linkbuilding methods.  Tom Schmitz explains what each of these link building techniques are, how the search engines perceive them, and whether or not you should include them in your SEO strategy.  Great read for anyone starting out in SEO and linkbuilding and trying to understand what works and what doesn’t.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/ugc/use-seomoz-toolbar-google-analytics-for-301-redirect-opportunities">Use SEOmoz Toolbar &amp; Google Analytics for 301 Redirect Opportunities</a></p>
<p>The guys over at <a href="http://www.ties.com/">Ties.com</a> wrote a great post that is very easy to implement even for novices.  It shows you step by step how to identify pages that target the same keywords that might be cannibalizing traffic and rankings from each other, how to identify which one you should pass all the page authority to, and then how to 301 redirect in order to generate even more traffic for the chosen page.  They even show proof of traffic and ranking increase.   Use this method if you have a large ecommerce site like Ties.com.</p>
<a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/mozcon-2012-wrapup">MozCon 2012 Wrapup</a>
<p>What better way to get over a SEO hangover than a little hair of the dog that bit you.  This is a great post giving you a glimpse inside one of the best SEO conferences in the world.  It actually makes me very jealous to read this post but there’s some great photos to browse through, a link to download all the presentations (tons of valuable content here), links to liveblogs from the events with some very interesting posts, and a collection of all the tweets compiled from the weekend.  This is an excellent MozCon and SEO resource, almost as good as being there.</p>

      <title>Hootsuite Adds All Google+ Pages for Social Media Management</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><br> Auto-publishing to Google+ just got easier since Hootsuite integrated Google+ Pages. Now nearly 5 million Google+ users can manage their accounts from Hootsiute.</p>
<p>Last year, Google+ Pages were integrated with Hootsuite, but that was only for 200 Enterprise pages. All Hootsuite users, regardless of whether they are under the Free or Enterprise plan, can manage their Google+ page directly from the dashboard.  This change was motivated by requests from over 12,000 Hootsuite users for Google+ Pages to be added.</p>
<p>“It was painful because obviously we have a lot of users that wanted to use this,” said Hootsuite’s VP of Business Development Greg Gunn. “But it was good tension because it showed a lot of desire to interact between businesses and consumers.”</p>
<p>Thankfully the social media management company complied, making life easier for social media manager everywhere.</p>
<p>In this blog, you’ll learn the definition of auto-publishing, how to add <a href="http://blog.hootsuite.com/google-plus-pages-open/" title="Google+ Pages to your Hootsuite  " target="_self">Google+ Pages to your Hootsuite</a> dashboard, and what features are available to you.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Auto-Publishing?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, auto-publishing is the process of scheduling a message (blog, tweet, or otherwise) to automatically release on certain websites chosen by you. Instead of posting your message manually on each website you want it to circulate, when you use an auto-publishing application such as Hootsuite or Tweetdeck, it will send your message automatically.</p>
<p><b>How to Add Google+ Pages to the Hootsuite Dashboard:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Login to your Hootsuite account</li>
<li>Find ‘My Social Networks’</li>
<li>Click ‘+Add a Social Network’</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s that easy. </p>
<p>Now that Google+ is added to your dashboard, let’s explore the array of features you can manage directly from Hootsuite.</p>
<p><b>Publish Messages to Your Circles</b></p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/google-%20hootsuite4-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="google  hootsuite4 resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">One of the neat things about Google+ is that it allows you to target specific audiences with certain messages by using the Circle filter. Whether you’re posting to certain circles or publicly, Hootsuite allows you to see public user activity and pop-up user profiles and company pages.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Manage Your Circles</b></p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/google-%20hootsuite-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="google  hootsuite resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">In-dash circle management allows you to add, edit or remove circles without ever leaving the simplistic interface of Hootsuite. You can also add or remove individual users from circles.</p>
<p><b>Measure Your Impact Using Google+ Analytics</b></p>
<p><b><img src="/Portals/123780/images/google-%20hootsuite2-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="google  hootsuite2 resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br></b></p>
<p>Google+ provides five in-dash analytic modules to measure results.</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily posts</li>
<li>Daily aggregated comments</li>
<li>Daily aggregated +1’s</li>
<li>Daily aggregated reshares</li>
<li>Circle growth</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Advanced Search Ability</b></p>
<p>Monitoring is made-easy now that users can create custom keyword or phrase searches within public posts and specific content streams.</p>
<p>Google+ has remained a contender in the battle for social media dominance. They continue to give users reasons to join their community of 5 million plus and Hootsuite management is only another point in their favor.</p>

      <title>Mobile Search Just Got A Lot Easier With Google Handwrite Release</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The inconvenience of using tiny keypad to type search queries on your mobile device is now over. A new way of searching has emerged at the hands of Google engineers.</p>
<p>From their <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/make-your-mark-on-google-with-handwrite.html">blog</a> -</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Say you’re standing on a busy street corner, in a bumpy taxi ride, talking with a friend, or sitting on the couch with your tablet. Handwrite enables you to search by just writing letters with your finger most anywhere on your device’s screen—there’s no keyboard that covers half of the screen and no need for hunt-and-peck typing.” </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="/Portals/123780/images/handwrite-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="handwrite resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Google’s latest update to mobile search allows users to write their search query directly on touchscreen devices.</p>
<p>Google Handwrite is a sleek and well-designed mobile feature that allows users to write characters anywhere on their touchscreen device using only their fingers.</p>
<p>Not only is “hunt-and-peck typing” no longer necessary, Google Handwrite allows users to type characters using their thumb while holding the phone at the same time. Which eliminates the need to use two hands to search.</p>
<p>Which devices can use Google Handwrite:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 5 version of Apple devices</li>
<li>Android 2.3 Gingerbread</li>
<li>Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich for tablets</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Handwrite currently accommodates an astounding 27 international languages.</p>
<p>How to activate Google Handwrite in your mobile browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click ‘Settings’ located at the bottom of the screen display</li>
<li>Activate “handwrite”</li>
</ul>
<p>Google assures users that Handwrite is meant to complement typing instead of replacing it, but with such an easy alternative to pecking, the user-friendly choice is clear. See for yourself.</p>

<p>The second LinkedIn feature is a new tab in the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/">LinkedIn Today dashboard</a> called “Trending in Your Network.”   According to the LinkedIn blog, “By simply clicking on this tab, members will have yet another filter to sort through all of the professional news articles and industry updates, based on those articles that are currently the most popular among members of their professional networks, regardless of their industry.”</p>
<p>It looks like LinkedIn is putting a lot of effort to promote LinkedIn Today, and I believe this could be a great way to generate buzz around your business and establish your company as the go to resource in your industry.  The question is how does one get featured on Linked in Today. </p>
<p>According to <a href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5010">Linkedin they look at these three factors</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The links that members share, like, and comment on the most</li>
<li>Based on the industry assigned to profiles</li>
<li>A higher preference is assigned to recent articles if they’re being shared quickly by a broad base of members</li>
</ol>

	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/SEO%20rewind-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="SEO rewind resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">Welcome to our new weekly segment where we take a look back at the most important happenings and most interesting articles that we find about SEO.  If we missed something be sure to let us know in the comments below. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/ugc/listening-to-the-web-with-google-reader-a-beginners-guide">Listening to the Web with Google Reader:  A Beginners Guide</a></p>
<p>This an extremely useful article we found about how to setup a web monitoring dashboard using Google Reader to help SEO’s spot trends in their industry, come up with content ideas, better engage with customers, and keep tabs on what the competition is doing.  It’s a great read and you should put the tactics he teaches into practice right after you read the article.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2191991/Google-Webmaster-Tools-An-Overview">Google Webmaster Tools:  An Overview</a></p>
<p>As we all know, Google Webmaster Tools is a must have tool for all SEO’s and Webmasters.  This is actionable information about your website coming from Google themselves, so we better learn how to listen to what they’re telling us.  This is an excellent guide that walks you through all the features in GWT and gives you some ideas on how to act on what you’re seeing.  PRO TIP:  Check out Bing Webmaster Tools also, they’re doing some pretty cool stuff over there.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-now-shows-you-your-most-recent-links-127903">Google Now Shows You Your Most Recent Links</a></p>
<p>Google recently added the new option to download your most recent backlinks in Google Webmaster Tools.  This article gives some some screenshots showing you where to find them and what the spreadsheet looks like once you download them.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/spotted-in-the-wild-sharing-pages-directly-from-search-results-to-google-127893">Official:  Google “Share” Experiment Sends Pages From Search To Google+</a></p>
<p>Berian Reed, head of search at AutoTrader UK recently spotted the ability of Google+ users to “share” links publicly and with their circles, directly from the search results page.   He shares his screenshotsMaybe this is only in the UK or only seen on certain SERP’s but we were unable to find any examples.  Sean Liu, Google’s Product Manager confirmed the experiment.  So keep your eyes peeled for this option in your SERP’s and take advantage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wordstream.com/articles/google-ads">Google Ads and the War on Free Clicks</a></p>
<p>A very informative infographic from the search marketing software company Wordstream, describing how pay per click ads are taking over Google’s Search Engine Results with paid listings getting almost double the amount of clicks as organic listings for keywords with “high commercial intent”.  There are some interesting statistics in here, but with Google ads taking up more and more real estate, I’m not surprised.  Check it out.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/search-engine-satisfaction-dips-slightly-google-bing-effectively-tied-127787">Search Engine Satisfaction Dips Slightly; Google &amp; Bing Effectively Tied</a></p>
<p>Bing has been doing some really cool things lately with their search engine, so Google better watch their back.  This article sums up the most recent <a href="http://www.theacsi.org/">American Customer Satisfaction Index</a> for search engines and Bing is only 1 point behind Google, although search engine satisfaction is also taken a hit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/why-link-building-strategies-fail">Why Link Building Strategies Fail</a></p>
<p>Awesome article which describes the different reasons why certain link building campaigns fail.  After describing these reasons, the author follows up by showing how to correct these common mistakes and “how to win.”  Great read along with links to valuable resources.</p>
<p>Well that’s it folks, this list will always very in length and number of articles.  We don’t want to stuff it with articles we don’t like just to make it a ten list.  But if we missed a great article on SEO, Google, or search marketing please let us know in the comments below.  See you next week.</p>

	<p><a href="http://butdoesitfloat.com/For-the-world-to-be-interesting-you-have-to-be-manipulating-it-all" target="_self"><img id="img-1342701188295" src="/Portals/123780/images/monitoring%20Social%20media-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="monitoring Social media resized 600" width="291" height="407" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></a>Whenever starting a new content marketing strategy it’s always a good idea to get a pulse of what the latest trends are in your particular market.  It’s also very important to keep a close eye on what your competitors are up to and what type of content they’re creating.  Here at Searchdog Marketing, with each new client we bring in, we like to set up a free tool for monitoring social media and really the web as a whole. </p>
<p>This free social monitoring platform or dashboard as we like to call it allows us to do in depth market research by aggregating information from all over the web into one central location, allowing us to spot trends and analyze their marketplace much more efficiently.</p>
<p>Another benefit a social web monitoring tool like this provides is content ideas.  We all struggle with coming up with ideas for that next blog post, and sometimes find ourselves staring at a blank page.  Especially as an agency, it can be very difficult to learn about several different industries and be able to come up with great topics for each of them.</p>
<p>I have found an excellent resource on how to build and use one of these social monitoring dashboards.  It goes into great detail about how to aggregate information from Google alerts, Twitter, Q&amp;A sites, Facebook, and more and bringing them into one centralized dashboard, Google reader.  You’ll love this article if you are doing content marketing, want to engage your target audience, or just want to spy on your competitors.</p>
<p>Here’s the link: <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/ugc/listening-to-the-web-with-google-reader-a-beginners-guide">Listening to the Web with Google Reader: A Beginner's Guide</a></p>
<p>Do you use any other tools to monitor your industry?  If so we'd like to hear about them, leave a comment and let our readers know.</p>

With all the options, concepts, and techniques offered in today’s online marketing world, it can be confusing to sift through the madness and actually convert your website visitors into paying customers.</p>
<p>The good and bad thing about online marketing is that it’s a constantly evolving game. A recent commenter on <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/144032/The-6-Step-Guide-to-Generating-Online-Reviews-on-Google-Local-Pages">one of our latest blogs</a> said it best “it seems like the rules are changing during the game.” We couldn’t have said it better! That is exactly what’s taking place and the big surge towards an advertising tactic called “retargeting” is a great example of just that.</p>
<p><b>What is Exactly is Retargeting?</b></p>
<p>In a nutshell, retargeting is term to describe a marketing strategy utilizing <a href="http://support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2453998&amp;from=173945&amp;rd=1">Google Adwords remarketing</a>, the process of specifically targeting your online ads to potential constomers who have already visited your website or a page within your site.</p>
<p>The process goes like this, someone lands on your site, be it by typing the url into the address bar, finding your site while doing a search on Google, clicking on an ad, clicking on a link in an email, or the multitude of other ways visitors can find their way to your site, it really doesn’t matter how they get there.  Once they land on your site, a cookie is dropped on their browser.  After that, for a length of time you specify, usually 30 – 90 days, whenever they visit a site that contains <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/www/en_US/tour/howitworks.html">Google sponsored ads</a> i.e. blogs, Gmail, Google partner sites, etc. they will see an ad you predetermine, and that is where it can get really interesting.</p>
<p>Think of retargeting as a cheap way to brand your company like the big boys.  Where companies like Coca Cola, Doritoes, Target, and insert large corporation here, are spending millions of dollars buying TV spots and product placements so that they can keep their brand on the minds of the consumer, companies that utilize retargeting are only spending money if and when someone actually clicks the ad.  Let me repeat that so it sticks, they only pay when someone actually clicks on one of their ads and returns to their site.  Sounds incredible doesn’t it?  And it is.  Some companies have seen up to a 53% increase in conversion rate with only a small portion of the impressions needed of a regular Adwords campaign.</p>
<p><b>How To Effectively Use Retargeting To Generate More Leads</b></p>
<p>Retargeting is a form of behavioral marketing.  A visitor comes to your website and performs certain behaviors based on where they are in the sales funnel, they might read several blog posts if they are searching for information, if they know what product they want but are shopping around for the best brand and price, they might sign up to receive a free demo or talk to customer service, if they’re ready to buy they make the purchase.</p>
<p>As technology gets smarter and smarter we are able to recognize these behaviors much easier and capitalize on them much faster, and retargeting is a way to do that.</p>
<p>So by creating specific retargeting campaigns for each of these behaviors, marketers are able to show a highly targeted ad to a prospect who has already performed a predetermined behavior. </p>
<p>Here’s an image from an <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/retargeting-basics-what-it-is-how-to-use-it">article by SEOmoz</a> that gives some examples of what ads can be used for each different step of a company’s sales funnel.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Let’s walk through a couple of examples so you understand.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re selling a coffee maker, and you’ve noticed that several people have started the checkout process but haven’t made it all the way through.  The coffee maker is nice and better than most products in its category but slightly more expensive.  The product is selling well, so you don’t want to lower the price to all customers, so you decide that maybe if you offer a discount to the customers who abandoned the shopping cart, you may increase your conversion rate. </p>
<p>This would be a perfect time to use remarketing.  All you would do is <a href="http://support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2454000&amp;topic=1713923&amp;path=1713922-1713909&amp;ctx=leftnav">setup a remarketing campaign in Google Adwords</a>, set the cookie to 30-90 days, create an attractive banner ad offering a %25 discount on your coffee maker, then watch and analyze the campaign and optimize based on the results.  My guess is the conversion rate skyrockets, and now you’ve recovered some of that lost revenue plus added a new customer which could result in more sales down the road.</p>
<p>Let’s look at one more.</p>
<p>So they’ve purchased your coffee maker and now become a customer.  Why not drop a retargeting cookie on the thank you page while you’re fresh on their mind and create a banner promoting your flavored coffee basket or his and her coffee mug set.</p>
<p>Are you starting to see the power?  The possibilities are endless and experimenting can be a fun and inexpensive way to figure out what your customers are looking for so you can create better products and packages to give them.</p>
<p>Do you have any interesting ideas on how companies could use remarketing to generate more leads or sale more products?  Be sure to leave your ideas in the comments section below.</p>

      <title>How To Turn Your "Almost Conversions" Into Paying Customers</title>

	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/almost%20conversions-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="almost conversions" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">What do online advertisers want more than anything? Lots of conversions. When we get conversions, we pat ourselves on the back and add them to the success pile so that we can keep count.<br><br> As our successful conversion number rises, we feel happier, but conversion analysis should really go a lot deeper than this if we are looking to find ways of making more people convert on a regular basis and turn our happiness into online marketing euphoria.<br><br> If we only ever measure the amount of successful conversions, we only ever get access to half of the data and this kind of analysis is seriously lacking in so many respects. Analyzing and having access to the amount of “almost conversions” that occur on your site is even more valuable in some ways than knowing how many people have actually converted.<br><br> Why?<br><br> If you know how many people almost converted, you can use this data to develop ways of re-marketing and making those people follow through to full conversion the next time.<br><br> Let’s look into this conversion funnel data analysis even further...<br><br><b>1. Why do people “almost convert” on your website?</b><br> Gathering data on the people that almost convert is actually a lot easier than most people might first think, which is why it is so strange to think that more people are not focusing on this intermediary information.<br><br> For example, let’s imagine that you own a business which sells products online and your internet customers have the opportunity to buy their products via your website and have them sent directly to their homes.<br><br> Most people with online businesses in this situation are only gathering data on actual conversions. So, when someone buys something, when money changes hands, this is when their online marketing analysis program (for example, Google Analytics) is set up to record the conversion. But what about all those people who go to your website and add products to the cart, but change their minds just before proceeding to check out?<br><br> We have all done this. We have all put something into an online buy basket, made our way to check out and then changed our minds, removing the product from the cart before purchase.<br><br> There are lots of reasons why this happens. For example:<br><br> 1. The internet user puts lots of items in the shopping basket and then realizes that they don’t have enough money to buy everything, so they take out some of the items.<br><br> 2. The internet user becomes suspicious as to the safety of the site and therefore doesn’t want to enter in their details.<br><br> 3. Some internet users might simply have lost internet connection just before the point of sale and had in fact intended to buy everything in their cart.<br><br> 4. Some internet users are affected by their own inner voices, telling them that they don’t need these products or that it might be best to shop around a little more to see if they can get a better price elsewhere before they commit.<br><br> The above ideas are just a few of the many reasons why some people might complete an “almost conversion” and it is important to find out when these “almost conversions” are taking place so that we can learn from them and make further improvements to our online marketing campaigns.<br><br><b>2. How can you find out how to gather data on the “almost conversions” on your site?</b><br> Collecting the data is easily done. Set up another conversion marker in your Google Analytics program which records the dropping of a product into the shopping cart as an actual conversion in its own right.<br><br> You will then be able to clearly see how many people land on your site, how many people get as far as putting things in the shopping cart and then how many people actually complete the entire conversion process and pay for their item.<br><br> It is that simple and the results that you will gather will be invaluable to you and to the analysis of your online advertising campaign as a whole.<br><br><b>3. What can you do with the data that you gather on the “almost conversions”?</b><br> The best thing to do with data that you gather on “almost conversions” as part of your online advertising campaigns is to follow up with a re-marketing campaign that targets those internet users that almost became customers to see if your re-marketing efforts will help to just tip the odds in your favor and get them to convert the second time around.<br><br> For instance, if the reason why one of your potential customers did not convert lies in the simple fact that the internet connection was lost at a crucial conversion moment, this internet user might have forgotten about the purchase they were going to make.<br><br> In this scenario, your re-marketing campaign will help to give them a gentle remind to return to your site and finish off the transaction once and for all.<br><br> If, however, the reason why your potential customer did not fully convert relates to inner doubt and the inner voice of that person telling them that they don’t really need your product, which happens quite regularly, your re-marketing campaign will act as the naughty little devil in their other ear, drawing them back to your site and to full conversion.<br><br> Remember, it is always easier to get a returning internet user, via re-marketing strategies, to convert than an internet user visiting your website for the first time. This is why “almost conversion” data is essential and why you need to make changes to the way in which your Google Analytics program records activity in your online advertising campaigns as soon as possible.<br><b><br></b><b><em>David Chapman is Director of Marketing at Webrageous, a highly experienced and successful <a href="http://www.webrageous.com/blog/google-adwords-management-means-mint-condition-campaigns/%20" title="Google AdWords Management Firm" target="_self">Google AdWords Management Firm</a> in Reno, Nevada. </em></b></p>

      <title>Why Your Business Should Join Google+ Today</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>By far the most anticipated updates to Google+ Local pages are the integration of social networking features and the Zagat review system. If you’ve already got a Google + Business page, you’re one step ahead of the game and on your way to receiving a full upgrade. If you don’t have a Google + Business page, create one today. Those of you who are still on the fence about whether or not you should invest the time and effort to build a Google+ Business presence will find several reasons in this blog of why you should hop on the bandwagon today.</p>
<p>Once the full Google + Local upgrade goes live, business owners can look forward to interacting directly with their customers from their Google+ Business page. After examining several enhanced <a href="http://googleandyourbusiness.blogspot.com/2012/05/helping-people-discover-and-share-local.html">Google+ Local pages</a> (Google gave some businesses a sneak preview), it’s safe to say local search will never be the same.</p>
<p>Here’s what you can look forward to with the full Google+ Local pages upgrade: </p>
<p><b><span style="color: maroon;">Expanded ‘About’ Section</span></b><span style="color: maroon;"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In place of the few “from the owner” lines that currently appear on the Google+ Local pages, upgraded pages provide enough space for a detailed description in the ‘about’ section. Pages can also link to a business menu.</span><b><span style="color: maroon;"><br></span></b></p>
<p><img id="img-1340294155859" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-21%20at%2011.44.27%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="about us section" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><b><span style="color: maroon;">Upload Photo Albums</span></b></p>
<p>Google Places pages only allow 10 photos to be uploaded. Google+ Business pages let business owners upload entire albums of photos, which makes for a more dynamic content experience. Albums appear first, followed by individual photos directly beneath them. Customers can upload public photos that are visible to everyone on the web and associated with that individual’s name. Anyone who views their profile on Google+, searches places, or views places that customers have reviewed will get a peek at their uploaded photos.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/photo%20gallery-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="photo gallery" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><b><span style="color: maroon;">Dual Circle Integration</span></b></p>
<p>Initially, Google hoped Places would serve as a tool for business owners and customers to socialize. That didn’t quite pan out, but Google+ will fulfill that function by integrating a Facebook and Twitter like feature that allows businesses and customers to add each other to their circles.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/circles-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="circles" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><b><span style="color: maroon;">Linked Videos</span></b></p>
<p>Another notch on Google’s content belt is the video tab that features any video you’ve uploaded to your Places page. Since Google also owns YouTube, we’re predicting the next logical step is to sync YouTube with Local pages. Makes sense, right? </p>
<p>With all the added and upgraded features, Google+ Local pages are making waves in the race to socialize search. There’s huge potential for businesses to boost positive reviews on Google by incentivizing. Now the job is up to business owners to actually capitalize on the obvious SEO and social media marketing opportunities provided.</p>

      <title>Google+ Local Pages Replace Google Places: Helpful Info for Business Owners</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>On May 31, Google made a move we all anticipated – merging Google + Business Pages and Google Places to birth a new product called Google + Local, which combines social networking with local search. </p>
<p>All Places pages were automatically converted to Google + Local pages yesterday morning to the tune of 80 million. Although business owners and users alike will suffer slight confusion for a short period, the robust nature of Google+ Local pages more than make up for it. It offers a more dynamic SERP experience by giving users the best of both worlds in a centralized location along with a few feature upgrades.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>New Improvements and Added Features</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New “Local” tab</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adoption of Zagat review system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-Platform integration across Google Maps, mobile, and search</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circles upgraded to find reviews/recommendations from friends</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Google+ has struggled with low user engaged at a level comparable to its rival Facebook. Business owners and marketers hoped to see more engagement, but users seemed to find little use in yet another social network. Now the introduction of Google+ Local makes it impossible for users to bypass Google+ and adds immense value for both parties.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Local Tab Added to Google+</b></span></p>
<p>The local tab displays local search results in to Google + making it arguably more robust than what appears in SERPs. Similar to the local search funtionality of Foursquare, users can filter results by different criteria. filtering by people in “your circles” will show what your friends, colleagues, and relatives recommend and reviews they have written about your search. </p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/local%20tab-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="local tab resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Adoption of Zagat Review System</b></span></p>
<p>The old star rating system was ousted by Zagat scores, which rate businesses along a 30-point scale. The scoring guide is below, so you can see exactly how much more detailed Zagat is compared to the old rating system. Reviewers can rate businesses based on food, décor, service, and cost per person.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/zagat-scoring-guide-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="zagat scoring guide resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-06%20at%2011.52.29%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="zagat scoring " class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Multi-Platform Integration Across Google Maps, Mobile, and Search</b></span></p>
<p>There are three ways to reach Google+ Local pages:</p>

<p>Mobile is a bit tricky right now, because you have to download the Google+ app on Android. iPhone users will have to wait until Google’s submission is reviewed and approved by Apple before they can see the changes. Apple has plans to launch it’s own maps app in June, which may cancel out the seamless access to maps that iPhone users are accustomed.</p>

<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>SEO Benefit of Local Pages</b></span></p>
<p>Google+ Local pages are indexed under Google Search, which is really good news for business owners who have claimed their Places pages. For those who haven’t, they are probably not as excited about being listed in Google SERPs. Absentee business owners are at the mercy of customers who review their businesses without their knowledge or response. Our suggestion is to claim those pages immediately, upload content, and start interacting with your reviewers.</p>

      <title>The 6 Step Guide to Generating Online Reviews on Google+ Local Pages</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Since Google rolled out Local pages earlier this month, business owners and marketers alike are knee deep in discussion about the googlization of local search. There are strong implications for the increased brand visibility and customer interactions once Local pages are synced with Google+ business pages. <img id="img-1340293895126" src="/Portals/123780/images/google-plus-local-pages-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="google plus local pages resized 600" width="298" height="149" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></p>
<p>This change will greatly impact the value of customer reviews, because they'll be more visible in Google+ and Google search. It's time to start thinking of ways to interact with customers and capture their experiences with your business. </p>
<p>Here’s an easy 6-step guide to boosting positive reviews for your business Google+ Local page:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><b><span style="color: maroon;">Create a Google + for Business page</span></b></span> – The next step Google will make is to add the abovementioned features to Google+ local pages. This will likely involve merging Google+ business pages and local pages. Get out in front of this ASAP by <a href="http://www.google.com/+/business/" title="creating a business page">creating a business page</a> and start making dynamic (video, photos) postings.<span><b><span style="color: maroon;"></span></b></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><b><span style="color: maroon;">Come up with a valuable incentive for customers to write Google reviews </span></b></span>– Needless to say it’s unethical from a PR standpoint to offer free money for customers to write reviews. With that said, there’s nothing wrong with ‘rewarding’ customers who share their experiences online. So, how can you ‘reward’ customers without seeming unethical or like you’re paying for reviews? <span><strong><span style="color: #800000;"></span></strong></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Add Local People to Your Circles</span></strong> - Once Google+ Local and Google+ Business pages are synced, you'll be able to add your friends, family, AND customers to your businesses circle. So, find Google+ users in your area and add them to your circle. Start by looking at your friends circles and branch out from there. Also, try finding locals using <a href="http://www.findpeopleonplus.com" title="findpeopleonplus.com" target="_self">findpeopleonplus.com</a>, this sight allows you to search for people in your area or niche and even lets you narrow your search using a demographics filter. This will not only help you with Google+ local listing, but will also help you in Google search when people in your circles search for your product or service. <strong><span style="color: #800000;"></span></strong></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Offer Incentives To Local Influencers for Customer Reviews</span></strong> - If you're using findpeopleonplus.com to look for local Plus users, you'll notice a Plusclout score.  Users with high Plusclout scores are active and have a large amount of followers or people in their circles. Find users in your area with large Plusclout scores and offer them an incentive for an honest review (Good or Bad). In other words don't buy positive reviews, tell them to be honest.  If you do get negative reviews it's a great way for you to interact with your customers, show them you're a brand that cares, and find ways to improve your products. A great example would be if you own a restaurant, offering an influencer a 50% discount on their meal if they will right a review.  PR reps employ this strategy frequently for magazine reviewers.  </span><b><span style="color: maroon;"><span></span></span></b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;"><span>Design in-store and online ads</span></span> – </b>The best way to get the word out to your customer using passive messaging is to post announcements in your physical location, website, and social media. People search for deals and coupons online, so while they’re on your website looking for a way to save on their next purchase, they’ll stumble upon your offer.  <b><span style="color: maroon;"><span></span></span></b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;"><span>Put a message on your receipts</span></span> –</b> If your business issues receipts to customers after they make a purchase, be sure to include a call-to-action on your receipt about your ‘write a review’ incentive or reward program.  And use those QR codes!!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, you’re ready to position yourself to take advantage of Google+ Local pages and all that comes with them. Beyond the flash, the real value of these pages are the customer reviews and 2-way communication features for businesses and customers.</p>
<p>Since these pages will be indexed in Google search, it’s very important that your business puts its best foot forward and cuts down on negative reviews. The Zagat review system will either make or break your businesses image. </p>

      <title>What Hootsuite’s Partnership with HubSpot Means for Marketers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Last week, HubSpot announced they are teaming up with Hootsuite to make the world a better place for marketers. After reading up on the details of this partnership, it’s clear this could have a tremendous effect on the ROI of Twitter for marketers.<img id="img-1339429854940" src="/Portals/123780/images/hubspotandhootsuite-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="hubspotandhootsuite resized 600" width="319" height="147" class="alignRight"></p>
<p>The Team HS &amp; HS are partnering to launch a new product integration, a webinar, multiple eBooks, and more that will help marketers close the loop to social marketing. All of which we at Search Dog Marketing are quite giddy about. Their partnership has birthed a new social media term or marketing technique called “closed-loop social media.” To test this new technique, marketers must sign-up to be part of the HS &amp; HS app beta program.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Here’s How the App Works:</b></span></p>
<p>If you’re a HubSpot AND Hootsuite Pro or Enterprise the app automatically pulls lead and keyword data from HubSpot into Hootsuite. Through this beta app, marketers can engage current and prospective leads that use top keywords from HubSpot. All of this can be done without leaving the Hootsuite interface.<img id="img-1339429887117" src="/Portals/123780/images/hubspot-hootsuite-1-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="hubspot hootsuite 1 resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><em>*Photo credit to HubSpot</em></p>
<p>Inside the Hootsuite dashboard, you’ll have two streams – contacts and keywords. In the Contacts Stream, you’ll be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>See Twitter messages from your HubSpot Contacts and engage them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a filter to show lead conversions </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Keywords Stream, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>See Twitter messages containing your HubSpot keywords</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and engage prospective and current leads by keyword usage on Twitter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a filter to show high performing keywords in Twitter</p>
<p><img id="img-1339429967077" src="/Portals/123780/images/hubspot-hootsuite-2-resized-600-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="hubspot hootsuite 2 resized 600 resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, this new app greatly enhances the marketing potential and user experience of Twitter.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>What Does Closed-Loop Social Media Mean for Marketers Using Hootsuite &amp; HubSpot?</b></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b><span style="color: #800000;">Added Value for Twitter</span> – </b>The debate amongst marketers and business owners about the real value of Twitter is ongoing. The truth is, the ROI is different for each business and depends greatly on how much you invest in Twitter as a means of marketing. If you’ve decided to throw in the towel for good, you should at least test this new app to see how your keywords and leads fair in this new environment.<b></b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><span style="color: #800000;">More Content Marketing is Necessary</span> - </b>Content marketing is needed, now more than ever, due to this partnership. The best way to acquire new leads is by relevant and search friendly creating content. Beef up your blog writing, eBooks, and infographics. If you want to keep new leads coming in, your content management wheels must keep spinning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Time to Reevaluate The Way You Nurture Leads </b></span>– if you’re only using emails to nurture leads through the sales funnel, you may want to examine ways to integrate social media. Even if you’re still not sold on the ROI of Twitter, it would be a shame to miss out on an opportunity to grow your business and reach more followers. Especially considering Hootsuite and HubSpot have gone out of their way to make it easier to identify and engage leads.<b> </b></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Go ahead and sign-up for the <a href="http://library.hootsuite.com/forms/hubspot-application-request/">App Beta Program</a>. HubSpot will share some eBooks soon to shed more light on ways to use the program in your overall social media marketing strategy. </p>

      <title>Facebook Rolls Out Mobile-Only Ads </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>It’s taken a while, but Facebook is finally announced it’s mobile-only ad product. This move comes as no surprise, because back when Mark Zuckerberg filed Facebook’s S-1 he identified the lack of mobile ads as a potential threat to the company’s growth.</p>
<p>Mobile is the future of social media, so launching mobile-only ads is a logical step.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Where Will The Ads Appear?</b></span></p>
<p>Facebook is giving marketers a few options about where desktop and mobile ads can appear for users to see. Mobile ads on Facebook are just Sponsored Stories that will appear in users news feed.</p>
<p><img id="img-1339443072941" src="/Portals/123780/images/facebook%20sponsored%20story-resized-600.PNG" border="0" alt="facebook sponsored story resized 600" width="220" height="329" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></p>
<p>Now you can pay money to have an add show up in your fans news feeds, as well as the news feeds of everyone in your fans networks. Which is way better than the simple right-side panel where Facebook ads normally call home.</p>
<p>Not only that, marketers can choose from the following placement combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All Placements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All Desktop Placements ONLY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News Feed – Desktop and Mobile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News Feed Desktop ONLY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News Feed Mobile ONLY</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know what your options are, the only thing left to do is to actually create a Facebook ad worth clicking AND create an offer worth accepting.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>How to Create a Facebook Ad or Sponsored Story Worth Clicking</b></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Determine what you’re promoting</b></span> – Whether it’s a new ad, post, or when people like your page or post, decide what activity you want showcased in your ad or sponsored story. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Targeting Demographics</b></span> – Facebook targeting features allow you to isolate audiences by location, language, education, work, age, gender, birthday, relationship status, likes, interests, friends of connections and connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Ad Designing</b></span> – To test different versions of your ad, use a few photos and change your titles after the ads ran for a few days. Not everyone will click on the same ad, so mix it up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Set Your Budget </b></span>– Do you want to pay cost-per-click or cost-per-impression? What is the maximum amount you want to pay on a daily basis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Evaluate </b></span>– Review your ads performance after a day or two and decide if you need to change some elements of the design. Whether it’s the ad copy, or the link, or the photo, try to find ways to improve and increase engagement.</p>
<p>As always, when in doubt, contact us and we'll help you get the ball rolling!</p>

      <title>9 Reasons Why People Unsubscribe From Your Email Marketing</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>People have a tendency to unsubscribe from email lists for several different reasons. So, there is no definite way to keep them from unsubscribing once they have deemed your email unnecessary or annoying. Previously, I blogged about only <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/103234/3-Common-Email-Marketing-Mistakes-That-Lead-to-Unsubscribes">three</a> email marketing mistakes that lead to unsubscribes. HubSpot recently brought nine reasons people lost interest to the table with an infographic. Their findings are quite interesting and relevant to a number of clients I<img id="img-1338301419827" src="/Portals/123780/images/hubspotinfographic-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="hubspotinfographic resized 600" width="469" height="1277" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"> encounter on a regular basis who express concern about their lack of effectiveness with email marketing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Here are the nine reasons people unsubscribe from permission emails, according to HubSpot:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">54%</span></strong> Said emails came too frequently</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">49%</span></strong> Found the content to be repetitive or boring over time</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">47%</span></strong> Received too many emails and decided to downsize</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>25%</strong></span> Found the content irrelevant </p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>24%</strong></span> Preferred to seek out information on their own</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>22%</strong></span> Signed up for a one-time offer</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>13%</strong></span> Circumstances changed [moved, married, changed jobs, etc.] </p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>8%</strong></span> Switched to another company that provided better information</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>6%</strong></span> Found an alternative way to get the same information [via blogs, Faceook, etc.] </p>
<p>As I stated earlier, these findings are very telling and provide a roadmap for marketers looking to revamp their approach. Thanks to this data, there’s no reason to guess about why people are unsubscribing and reporting you as spam.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Here are 5 key takeaways:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Decrease the number of emails you send to either one or two a month.</b></span> There really is no reason to inndate people’s inboxes with your marketing messages. If they opted in to emails, they’re interested in what you have to say, but too much of anything is a bad thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Don’t email the entire list all the time.</b></span> Chances are that every message you have isn’t relevant to all your customers at the same time. When subscribers opt-in to your email list, make sure you give them options to choose from regarding what type of communication they’d like to receive from you. If all they want is discounts and contests for specific brands, don’t send them a blanket e-newsletter. This is called targeting. Target the people who are most likely to open your email and your results won’t look so pathetic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Be findable online. </b></span>This is basic inbound marketing 101. Not everyone wants to be communicated with; some prefer to seek out information. Your search engine optimization and user experience know-how should kick in right about now. Using keywords, Google Places, pay-per-click ads, landing pages, etc. is the best way to leave a trail of breadcrumbs that lead back to your site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Add one-time offer subscribers to a separate list. </b></span>There’s nothing more annoying than signing up for a contest to win a free trip or gift card and suddenly finding yourself on the receiving end of a barrage of unwanted emails. You hate it when companies do it to you, so why adopt this strategy for your business? That’s a rhetorical question. You absolutely shouldn’t do this. If you’re running a one-time offer, add those people to a separate list and leave them off your general email list. Send similar offers to them to nurture the lead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><span style="color: #993300;">Subscribe to your competitors email lists</span>. </b>This isn’t cheating. It’s environmental monitoring. If 8% of respondents said they unsubscribed and switched to your competitors email because your content is irrelevant, you should find out what your competitors are doing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Email marketing isn’t a science and you don’t have to be a million dollar marketing agency to ward off unsubscribes. Email marketing IS a delicate dance you should only try if you know the moves. Once someone unsubscribes, they’re lost forever. So, email with caution, offers, call-to-actions, and do so sparingly. </p>

      <title>What Twitter's Weekly Email Digest Means for Marketers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/05/best-of-twitter-in-your-inbox.html">recent announcement</a> of a weekly email digest from Twitter has marketers excited about what promise this potentially holds for their Twitter campaigns. The digest features the most relevant tweets and stories shared by the people you’re connected with in the Twittersphere.</p>
<img id="img-1338308641228" src="/Portals/123780/images/email-screenshot-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="twitter weekly email digest" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"><p>Similar in design to the <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/05/discover-better-stories.html">Twitter Discover tab</a>, the email digest highlights a snapshot of the most popular stories and tweets from the past week. You can click through to see the tweets and retweet stories and share your comments. Headlines are clickable and related tweets from your followers are viewable. Even if you’re not following someone, their tweets might appear in your inbox if your followers found them engaging enough to favorite or retweet.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, this is great news for social media marketers. This weekly email digest means that your tweets concerning e-books, blogs, discounts and more have a greater chance of resonating with your followers and their followers.</p>
<p>The half-life of a link is a lot less than 3 hours. That’s a tiny window of opportunity for social media marketers to gain brand visibility. Twitter’s digest will open that window for a longer period of time. It’s important for brands to have a stronger Twitter presence if they truly want to capitalize on the opportunity being presented here. Add more social media optimization by providing links back to your website and embedding buttons/links on your blogs and landing pages.  </p>
<p>Be on the lookout for Twitter’s weekly digest in your inbox over the next few weeks. After I receive one, I will analyze it for optimization and overall effectiveness and let you guys know what I think.</p>

      <title>6 Easy Steps to Create Custom Tabs for Facebook Business Pages</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Since the <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/127597/5-Things-Brands-Should-Know-About-Facebook-Timeline-Brand-Pages" title="new Facebook design" target="_self">new Facebook design</a> launched earlier this year, I’ve noticed many business pages are slow to catch on to the custom tabs feature. Not the big brands, of course, they were early adopters of Facebook tabs for obvious reasons. It’s the small to medium sized businesses that are not so quick on the uptake.</p>
<p>In this blog, I’ll go into detail about how to create custom tabs for Facebook business pages to optimize and improve lead generation. Fortunately, it is not overly complicated or something you would need the assistance of a professional developer to complete.</p>
<p>Here’s how it’s done:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps" title="https://developers.facebook.com/apps">https://developers.facebook.com/apps</a> and log in using your usual information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <b>‘Create a New App’</b> and input a <b>‘Display Name’</b> and <b>‘namespace,’</b> for your app. Display name is what your tab will be called on your Facebook page. It’s for the world to see, so come up with something simple and easily identifiable. Namespace is your unique ID that we’ll refer back to later in the process.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/createnew%20app-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Create New App" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter your <b>‘Basic Info’</b> in to the appropriate fields. This is all pretty self explanatory in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/basic%20info-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="basic info resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create whatever content you want to display in your app. The easiest thing to do is create a landing page on your website with call to actions around whatever campaign you want this app to facilitate. Here are the exact dimensions you need to follow: Set width to either 100%, 520px or 810px. Images and videos need to be less than 520px or 810px.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go back to the Facebook development page and scroll down to select <b>‘how your app integrates with Facebook.’</b> There a handful of ways your app can integrate with Facebook. For the purposes of this blog, and to keep it simple, we’re only going to click <b>‘Page Tab.’ </b>Name your tab, copy and paste the URL for the webpage you just created in the previous step, provide a secure URL, add your image, and click <b>Wide (810px). </b>Be sure to save your changes.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-05-17%20at%2011.38.19%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="facebook custom tab" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add your tab to your Facebook page by visiting the following link: <span style="color: #ff6600;">http://www.facebook.com/dialog/pagetab?app_id=<strong>YOUR_APP_ID</strong>&amp;next=<strong>YOUR_URL</strong></span></p>
<p>Before you visit the link, you need to make some changes to it. In the above URL, replace the <b>“YOUR_APP_ID”</b> and <b>“YOUR_URL”</b> with the information Facebook provides on the Developers page. Go to your Summary and plug in your <b>App ID/API Key</b> and your <b>Site URL</b> into the above URL. Once you do this, your app will be included in the row of tabs on your Facebook business page.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That wasn’t so hard, was it? A little tedious, yes, but definitely not impossible to figure out. Now that your custom tab is up and running, you can re-order it, so it’s located exactly where you want.</p>

      <title>Bing to Unveil Social Sidebar in Upcoming Revamp</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Bing latest announcement proves they are approaching social media much differently than its rival Google.<img id="img-1337019164397" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-05-14%20at%2012.14.59%20PM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Bing Social Sidebar" width="486" height="284" class="alignRight"></p>
<p>The soon to be unveiled Bing revamp will aim at socializing the search interface, according to Microsoft. Instead of creating a social network to rival with existing sites like Facebook and Twitter, Bing’s search interface chooses integration via a social sidebar that includes Facebook, Twitter and Google+. LinkedIn, Quora, and Foursquare are on the coming soon list. </p>
<p>Here’s how it will work: you search for “sushi restaurants” in Bing and the right side column will display a “people you know who may know” section with content about “sushi restaurants” from your social network connections. Also in this column is a “people who know” section that highlights experts on “sushi restaurants” from all the connected networks.</p>
<p>This new approach provides keen insight into your friend’s opinions and expert opinions of your search queries.</p>
<p>"We're moving beyond the pages into entities. Those entities are people, places, things and their relationships," said Qi Lu, Microsoft's president of online services. "In the real world that's how it works: We use search, then we talk to people," Lu said.</p>
<p>The Facebook integration allows users to interact with Facebook directly from Bing. For example, post a question or comment about a sushi restaurant and tag one of your friends. That post will appear with a link back to Bing’s search page.</p>
<p>From the center column, users can interact with businesses directly by hovering over the business name. The social sidebar will appear offering more detailed information about business itself, including a link to Open Table to make instant reservations without leaving Bing.</p>
<p>Microsoft still has a few things to iron out with this new interface. Like how the social sidebar will appear on smartphones. Even with that uncertainty, we’ve got to hand it to Microsoft for choosing a different route to achieve social media integration.</p>
<p>Although Google is still the forerunner in search engines, it would be a mistake for anyone to count Microsoft out completely.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about the new Bing?</p>

      <title>How to Clean Up Your Twitter Feed</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/twitclean-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="twitclean resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Are you sick of all the noise on your Twitter timeline? By noise, we mean spam, repeat texts, eggs, and inactive accounts. Well, there’s an app for that and it’s absolutely free.</p>
<p><a href="http://thetwitcleaner.com/">Twit Cleaner</a> is a program that analyzes the accounts and tweets of all your followers to identify patters of behavior. Once identified, you have the option and ability to unfollow accounts that exhibit spammy or dodgy behavior to reduce the noise level on your timeline.</p>
<p>Twit Cleaner breaks the spammy accounts down by the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Dodgy</b> – spam phrases, @ spamming, duplicate links, duplicate tweets, app spam, advertising networks, etc.</li>
<li>
<b>Absent </b>– No updates in a month, fewer than 10 tweets, deleted &amp; suspended accounts</li>
<li>
<b>Repetitive</b> – High numbers of duplicate tweets or links</li>
<li>
<b>Flooding</b> – So high volume you can’t see anyone else</li>
<li>
<b>Non-Responsive</b> – No interation, those that follow back &lt; 10%, streams that are all feeds (facebook, twitterfeed, etc.)</li>
<li>
<b>Little New Content</b> – Retweeting lots or just posting quotes</li>
<li>
<b>Not Very Interesting</b> – People who talk about themselves a lot, or aren’t followed back very much</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you grant Twit Cleaner access to your account, it takes a few moments to categorize all your followers into the appropriate groups. Of course, you have to indicate whether or not you want someone to unfollow someone by clicking on their profile.</p>
<p>Twit Cleaner is a quick fix to solving your clogged timeline issue, but the root of your Twitter problem is most likely a combination of your Twitter strategy and the quality of people who are following you and vice versa. To ensure you attract quality followers, practice these few steps routinely to mix up your content.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Post Tweets Manually</b> – heavy reliance on tools like Hootsuite and Tweetdeck to schedule and post to your social media accounts says to your followers that you do not have time to interact with them. Even if it’s for an hour a day, make time to post tweets manually. Say something funny or respond to some of your followers tweets. Let them know the lines of communication are open.</li>
<li>
<b>Personal Content  -</b> It’s ‘okay’ to post a few personal tweets from time to time to let your followers know there’s not a bot behind every tweet you post. The whole point of Twitter is to interact with and follow the PEOPLE you want to know more about. Keep it appropriate of course. Going to the bar may not be the best personal content to share, but going to a conference or watching a webinar definitely is sharable and relevant.</li>
<li>
<b>ReTweet –</b> At this point, one would think everyone understands that retweeting is common courtesy on Twitter. Sadly, there are many businesses and marketers who make a practice of NOT doing so. Follow thought leaders in your field, people in your city or town, and RT the content you like or find useful. They will appreciate it and possibly return the favor one day. Even if they don’t, RTing provides diversity in your own content, which is always needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out Twit Cleaner for yourself to find out just how many dodgy accounts you’re following. No matter what any one tells you, it is NOT wise decision to follow everyone who follows you. Just like in life, be strategic about the relationships you form on Twitter. Who you follow says a lot about you and whether or not you’re paying attention to detail.</p>

      <title>So Your Site Got Hit By Google's "Penguin" Update, Now What?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Unless you’ve been under a rock for the past week, you know that Google released it's new <a href="http://searchengineland.com/the-penguin-update-googles-webspam-algorithm-gets-official-name-119623" title="Penguin Update" target="_self">Penguin Update</a> targeting websites with what they deem as over-optimization.<img id="img-1335469498927" src="/Portals/123780/images/spam-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="google over-optimization" width="276" height="172" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></p>
<p>Before you declare war on Google’s web spam team, understand that only 3% of users will be impacted by this penalty. You can find out if your website has been negatively impacted by doing a simple Google search of your website and related keywords. If your sites are not showing up as they once did, your site has potentially been effected by Google’s Penguin update.</p>
<p>Whether think it's fair or right doesn't matter, Google is in charge and they want what they want.  So your initial reaction is probably panic, but that won't help anyone.  Just stay calm and take the steps below to align your site with Google's guidelines and after a few months you'll probably be ok.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Analyze you on-page optimization<br></b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Are you stuffing keywords in your meta tags, content, or hiding them with invisible font in the footer? Does your site take forever to load? Does your content provide the visitor with exactly what they're looking for?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Clean title tags first. Use only one to two keywords in your title tags, and if possible try to include branded terms like the name of your company if you have enough room. Title tags should be 65 characters in length.  If you have duplicate title tags two separate pages, change one of them and take the opportunity to target another keyword.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Don't hide keywords or stuff them at the bottom of the page period.  Think of your visitor, tactics like that add zero to the user experience, so get rid of them.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Sprinkle your targeted keywords and different variations throughout your content but don't over do it to the point that it doesn't make since.  Again this goes back to adding something to the users experience</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Check load time if it takes a long time, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html" title="check out this resource" target="_self"><span style="color: #000000;">check out this resource</span></a>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Correct any more HTML validation errors</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Rewrite pages with duplicate content with unique valuable content</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Look at the sites that are still ranking.  What does their content offfer that yours doesn't? Some might still suck to be fair, but try to pick out the things that are good and make notes from all the different sites of the parts that you liked.  With your content try to answer the questions in the head of your visitor and provide thorough answers for them.  No more short sales copy.  Give them exactly what they want.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Add other forms of media that add value i.e. a video or high quality unique photos.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Analyze your backlink profile</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Go to http://opensiteexplorer.org and enter your site in the search bar.   It will bring back a list of your 1000 best backlinks for free and 10000 best backlinks if you have a pro account.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Perform the same task for the top 5-10 competitors that currently rank for the keywords your site dropped from.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">First look at the "anchor text" tab at the top. How does your anchor text distribution compare to your competitors? Do you overuse the keyword you were targeting relative to your competitors?  Are you mixing in branded terms as your anchor text such as "Acme Company Inc." or "www.acmecompany.com." Google looks at link profiles that have too much exact anchor text links as unnatural.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Next start going through your backlinks and read the names of the sites and maybe visit a few.  Are they relevant to your website? Checkout the DA (Domain Authority) is it over 30.  Anythin under probably 25 is probably a low quality backlink, too many of them could be looked at as spam.  <br></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Several big blog networks were deindexed before Google's Penguin Update, so look for signs that your links might come from one of these networks if so your site was most likely flagged.  To spot these look for blogs and find your links.  Do they have perfect exact anchor text? Are they surrounded by barely readable text? If so thats probably a blog network.  Also you can run a search like "site:questionablesite.com" and see if the site is still indexed.  If it doesn't bring back any results the site has been deindexed.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you spot any of these questionable links, you can try to get them taken down.  But fair warning this is a long, tedious process and will probably not be very successful.  But if you want to try find the webmasters contact info and shoot them an email to ask them to take your link down.  You can also try to find their info by doing a <a href="www.whois.net/" title="whois search." target="_self">whois search.</a></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993333;">Future steps to "Penguin" proof your website</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Blog, Blog Blog - Google wants great content so give it to them.  If you can't get rid of spammy links, consistent blogging and adding shareable content is a great way to conteract them.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Build natural "white hat" links - some great ideas are guest blogging on blogs in your niche, creating viral linkbait (infographics, contests, extensive resource page on a topic, widgets and badges, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Build relationships with people in your niche - use sites like Twitter and LinkedIn to find experts in your niche and start a conversation with them they will be an extremely valuable resource.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Get Social - if your not on the major social sites already, shame on you.  Create a Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and deifinitely Google + and get social.  I know this can seem like a waste of time but look at it like just another business task.  Or better yet hire us:)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #000000;">So that's all I got for you for now.  Take those steps and wait it out, and I think you'll be ok.  Stay tuned to this blog for some other great tips to help you counter the evil PENGUIN! </span><br><p><span style="color: #000000;">If you find yourself completely miffed by this latest update and need help accessing whether your site’s SEO, our experts will gladly chat with you.</span></p>

      <title>What Google’s Web Spam Algorithm Update Means for Your SEO</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p> </p>
<p>Spamming, inorganic and backlink building SEOs beware. Google’s latest update, which went <a href="http://searchengineland.com/did-googles-search-results-get-better-or-worse-119469?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed-main">live yesterday</a>, is targeting these tactics to improve search results and reward quality content.</p>
<img id="img-1335463729825" src="/Portals/123780/images/googles_matt_cutts-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="Googles Over Optimization Penalty" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"><p>The over-optimization penalty update was announced by Google’s head of the web spam team,</p>
<p>Matt Cutts, at the recent South by Southwest (SXSW). Cutts who had this to say <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2012/04/another-step-to-reward-high-quality.html">about the update</a>.</p>
<p><em>“Normally we don’t sort of pre-announce changes, but there is something that we’ve been working on in the last few months. And hopefully, in the next couple months or so, in the coming weeks, we hope to release it. ... So all those people who have sort of been doing, for lack of a better word, “over optimization” or “overly” doing their SEO, compared to the people who are just making great content and trying to make a fantastic site, we want to sort of make that playing field a little bit more level.”</em></p>
<p>Before you join the bandwagon of angry SEOs, let’s discuss what this update means for your content and your practices.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>What is Web Spam?</b></span></p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that Google has set <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=35769#3">guidelines</a> on what it considers “quality” content. If you’re breaking the rules, you probably already know them, but we don’t want to leave any room for confusion.</p>
<p>Google identifies web spam as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=66358">Keyword stuffing</a>,</li>
<li>
<a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=66356">Link schemes</a>, <b></b>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=66355">Cloaking, sneaky Javascript redirects, and doorway pages</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=66359">Intentionally duplicated content</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>White Hat SEO vs. Web Spam</b></span></p>
<p>Cutts made it clear that Google’s intention is not to interfere with white hat SEO, but to eliminate web spam. Their goal is to reward <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-quality.html">high-quality sites</a> and great content, which you should already be publishing. Actually, web masters should ONLY be linking to quality content. According to Google, this update will only impact about 3% of English sites.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Positive Implications for Content Marketing</b></span></p>
<p>The key takeaway from Google’s update is that content is king. Marketers should focus their efforts on creating dynamic, quality, shareable content that creates a good user experience. Aggressive web spam tactics will not be as successful now. Which means, marketers and SEOs should spend more time writing blog posts, white boards, videos, infographics and other inbound types of content that will rank organically.</p>
<p>We’ve written a few blogs about content marketing and inbound marketing that are helpful for SEOs looking to make the shift.</p>

      <title>Google Plans to Roll Out New Brand Measuring Tools</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Measuring online advertisings impact on a brand is difficult, if not impossible. That was until Google announced the development of an online brand metric tool that will speak to the plight of traditional and non-traditional brand marketers everywhere.</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://doubleclickadvertisers.blogspot.com/2012/04/making-web-work-for-brand-marketers.html">Brand Activate Initiative</a> is “an ongoing Google effort to address these challenges and re-imagine online measurement for brand marketers.” With this initiative, Google is working to build useful brand metrics into the tools marketers are already using to manage their online advertising campaigns. The ultimate plan is for this new tool to measure an ad’s ability to drive sales or think favorably of the brand - something that has miffed marketers since the early days of TV.</p>
<p>Google rolled out the first two Brand Activate solutions last week and here’s what we’ve gathered thus far:</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7yBemw0eW9g" width="560"></iframe>
<p><b>Active View</b><b> </b></p>
<p>In just a few weeks, marketers will get a chance to test-drive this technology within Google Display Network Reserve, which counts “viewed” impressions that tell whether a consumer viewed an ad or clicked away. According to Google, Active View will be submitted for Media Rating Council accreditation, as it is defined by the IAB’s proposed standard of at least a 50% viewable display ad for at least one second. </p>
<p>Once in place, advertisers will only pay for viewed impressions. Active View will become the universal currency and be offered within <a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick/" title="DoubleClick for Advertisers" target="_self">DoubleClick for Advertisers</a>. Google has future plans to work on viewed impression standards along with the IAB and other partners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Active GRP</b></p>
<p>GRP means gross rating point, which is TV advertising metric used to measure the reach and frequency of a TV ad. Google’s Active GRP is the online equivalent, which will extend brand marketing from offline to online in the same capacity.</p>
<p>Since Active GRP will be integrated into Google’s present ad tools, marketers will have the flexibility to adjust ads in real time, which is not possible with traditional advertising campaigns. Google has already launched a pilot program for DoubleClick for Advertisers clients and plans to integrate it with other products.</p>
<p>Not only that, Active GRP compensates for potential panel skewing and reliance on one data source thanks to its robust methodology. According to Google, “Active GRP is calculated by a statistical model that combines aggregated panel data and anonymous user data (either inferred or user-provided), and will work in conjunction with Active View to measure viewed impressions.”</p>
<p>This methodology will also be submitted to <a href="http://mediaratingcouncil.org/">MRC.</a></p>

      <title>LinkedIn Announces Targeted Follower Tools for Marketers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>LinkedIn is upping the ante for marketers with company pages by integrating two new features: Targeted Updates and Follower Statistics.</p>
<p><img id="img-1334934463763" src="/Portals/123780/images/targeted-audience-screenshot-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="linkedin targeted follower tool" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The goal of these features is to help companies develop lasting relationships with professionals in the social web. Which has become increasingly difficult to achieve considering cluttered inboxes and website visits declining.  For the time being, only a handful of early release partners (AT&amp;T, Samsung Mobile, Dell, and Microsoft) have access to the new features. The rest of us will get to try our hand at these features very soon.</p>
<p>Here’s a break down of what we have to look forward to:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Targeted Updates</b></span> will give marketers the ability to send status updates to different segments of followers. This means you no longer have to send out mass messages to all your followers. Instead you can segment by the following variables: Company Size, Industry, Job Function, Seniority, Geography, and Employees/Non-Employees.</p>
<p><img id="img-1334934503637" src="/Portals/123780/images/targeted%20audience-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="LinkedIN targeted follower tools" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Here’s what a Microsoft employee thinks of the new features:</p>
<p><em>"Targeted updates are really exciting because it's going to allow Microsoft to message through our followers on LinkedIn, specific messages based on the audience. ... which should provide our customers with more value because the messages are specific to them..."</em><em> - Kyle Cressman, Group Manager of Digital Marketing at Microsoft</em></p>
<p><a href="http://marketing.linkedin.com/sites/default/files/attachment/LinkedIn_TargetedUpdates_0.pdf">LinkedIn data</a> boasts that targeted updates have shown a 66+ increase in audience engagement.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Follower Statistics</b></span> will provide a mini dashboard under the status bar with insights and analytic data to help marketers better understand their follower demographics and engagement updates. Analytic data is priceless information to have for any marketing campaign. Beyond that, analytics data is critical to successfully engaging followers.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/follower%20statistics-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="follower statistics resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>LinkedIn so graciously provided 5 tips for creating engaging updates, and they are:</p>

      <title>3 Marketing Ideas To Capitalize On The Facebook Buy Out Of Instagram</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Facebook’s latest purchase of Instagram comes on the heels of it’s very recent introduction to the Android market, which sparked the introduction of thousands (maybe millions) of new Instagramers into the world of mobile photography.</p>
<img id="img-1334344666192" src="/Portals/123780/images/instagram%20for%20business-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="instagram for business resized 600" width="204" height="204" class="alignRight" style="height: 204px; width: 204px; float: right;"><p>Marketers are still figuring out how to harness the power of Instagram to engage consumers. A few months ago, we wrote an article on <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/122850/3-Instagram-Best-Practices-For-Brands">three Instagram best practices for brands</a>. That was before the Facebook deal and Android market release, so we’re hoping that now more marketers and business owners will embrace the notion of Instagram.</p>
<p>Whether you think Instagram is worth the extra effort or not is not the question. The heart of the matter is that your customers and potential customers (especially if they are in the 18-24 demographic) are most likely already using Instagram to photograph your business specifically OR your competitors. The conversation is already taking place. Just like any other social media scenario, if you want to be involved in the message development, you must join and become active. Simple as that.</p>
<p>The previous Instagram blog touched on three best practices. This blog will give you a few SPECIFIC ways to create sharable content using Instagram.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Give Viewers a Behind-the-Scenes Look at Your Business</b></span></p>
<p>People are always curious about how businesses operate, products are selected and made, etc. So, why not tell those stories through photos using Instagram? That was a rhetorical question by the way.</p>
<p>Take your cell phone camera and start documenting your business processes. If you own a bar or restaurant, you can take pictures of food and drinks, taste testing with employees and customers, incoming shipments of veggies and friends, etc. Help customers see and understand how goods and services are chosen and developed in your company.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Push Posts to Twitter &amp; Facebook to go Viral</b></span></p>
<p>Zuckerberg commented that he would largely leave Instagram alone, because it’s already wildly successful. I’m sure a few Facebook integrations are on the horizon, but as of right now, you can still post to Twitter and Facebook. From within the app itself, you can publish to both sites in an instant. Use @ mentions and hashtags for Twitter, so you reap the viral benefits. Just be sure you aren’t posting every single photo to Facebook and Twitter. That will quickly cause a domino effect of unfollows and unlikes by your audience. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Use 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Applications to Enhance Instagram Photos</b></span></p>
<p>People have already started adding ways to trick out your Instagram photos, because adding a filter is not the only thing you can do with Instagram. Third party developers have created applications that can add extra effects to your photo, making it even more likeable. Apps like <a href="http://web.stagram.com/">Webstagram</a>, <a href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a>, <a href="http://printstagr.am/">Printstagram,</a> and <a href="http://stickygram.com/">StickyGam</a> add a little extra umph to photos and allow some versatility in terms of usage. Currently, Instagram only allow you to curate pictures online, but the other applications allow you to print, make magnets, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to stay on the cutting edge of social media, take Mark Zuckerberg’s lead and hop on the Instagram band wagon. Start telling the story of your business through photos and share them with your customers. </p>

      <title>Facebook Buys Instagram for $1 Billion in Cash and Stocks</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1334076532711" src="/Portals/123780/images/facebook%20buys%20instagram-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="facebook buys instagram resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg has done it again. Yesterday, he announced that Facebook will purchase the popular photo-sharing app, Instagram, for $1 billion. Now the world is left to speculate about what changes, if any, Facebook will make to the two-year old app, which recently became <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/03/instagram-android-launches/">available on Android phones</a>. Previously, it was an iPhone only app.</p>
<p>Critics of Facebook and supporters on Instagram are not too pleased with this news. They took to <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-reactions-1-billion/#58055Is-the-Past-Repeating-Itself">Twitter yesterday</a> with their grievances after the news broke. One of their major concerns is that the social media giant will swallow the novelty app that more than 30 million users have grown to love and use regularly. A similar situation took place after Facebook purchased Gowalla back in December 2011.</p>
<p>It may not be quite as easy for Facebook to stall Instagram’s momentum considering its massive following even before the Android app was launched. Now that its available on the Android market, it is clear that Instagram will quickly reach 50 million users in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg made a public announcement that shed some light on reasons why he went through with the deal. This is what he had to say:</p>
<p>“This is an important milestone for Facebook because it’s the first time we’ve ever acquired a product and company with so many users. We don’t plan on doing many more of these, if any at all. But providing the best photo sharing experience is one reason why so many people love Facebook and we knew it would be worth bringing these two companies together.”</p>
<p>Or maybe Zuckerberg was nervous about Instagrams growth and thought it wise to purchase the app at twice the value investors calculated.</p>
<p>Either way, for $1 billion Facebook acquired Instagram and all of its employees. Facebook has set its sights on mobile growth and they are one step closer to complete social media domination with this recent takeover.</p>
<p>The real question is, why didn’t Google step forward before Facebook? Google+ could have benefited from a mobile app such as this. It’s too late for Google, because Sir Zuckerberg snatched up Instagram for roughly $1 billion in a combination of cash and stock.</p>
<p>We will join the rest of the world in intense anticipation to see what features are developed and dumped.</p>

      <title>New Google Analytics Layer Reports Social Media ROI</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The business value and return on investment for social media marketing has been the source of much debate among business owners and marketers alike. The Google Analytics Team recently rolled out their attempt to provide a solution – the new <span style="color: #800000;"><b>Social Reports</b>.</span></p>
<p><img id="img-1333741527599" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-04-06%20at%201.50.58%20PM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Google Analytics Social Reports" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The new Social Reports allow marketers to measure customer behavior on their website in real-time and measure the upper-funnel value of social media marketing efforts. In a recent <a href="http://www.analytics.blogspot.com/2012/03/capturing-value-of-social-media-using.html">blog</a> titled “Capturing the Value of Social Media Using Google Analytics,” Google commented that even though social media has grown in popularity in recent years, brand websites remain the number one place where consumers purchase and convert.</p>
<p>This means two very important things for inbound marketers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimize and make websites user-friendly, and </li>
<li>Tie in social media campaigns with online performance and conversion goals</li>
</ol>
<p>The good news is Google makes the latter of those two important things super easy with the Social Report.  According to Google’s blog, Social reports help marketers accomplish three things,</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">1.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Identify the full value of traffic coming from social sites and measure how they lead <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>to direct conversions or assist in future conversions</span></strong></p>
<p>In order to pull in data regarding the full value of your social media marketing efforts, you need to define goals and the value of those goals. Google advises tailoring it to your business. When a customer is referred from a social media site and converts immediately that is called Last Interaction Social Conversion. If a social media referral leads to a conversion at a later time, that is called Assisted Social Conversion. The visualization below shows how this will all appear in Google Analytics.</p>
<p> <img id="img-1333741700740" src="/Portals/123780/images/social-overview-1332936306-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="social overview" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The Conversions Report allows you to see exactly which goals are impacted by social media, classifies them as either assisted or last interaction and identifies the social media source. This way, you know what’s working and what needs improvement.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>2.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span></b><b>Understand social activities happening both on and off of your site to help you optimize user engagement and increase social key performance indicators</b></span></p>
<p>Prior to this new report rollout, Google Analytics only reported data and customer behavior on the website itself. A new Activity Stream tab shows how people are engaging with your web content in Google + and other brands like Badoo, Disqus, Echo, Hatena and Meetup. Social key performance indicators.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/google-analytics-activity-stream-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="google analytics activity stream resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> </b><b>Make better, more efficient data-driven decisions in your social media <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>marketing programs</b></span></p>
<p>With all this analytics data at your fingertips, it should be a lot easier to make the argument for social media marketing. Now more than ever, it is vital to design and implement social media marketing programs in alignment with data-driven decisions, as is the case with any marketing program. Before you start coming up with a social media strategy, take some time to analyze how much social media matters to your business by analyzing the Social Report.</p>

      <title>How to Create a Personalized Inbound Marketing Strategy</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Inbound marketing is not a set it and forget it or do it once type of marketing bit. It is no longer sufficient to rely solely on outbound marketing to generate leads and boost sales. The best way to position your business website and related content to be found by potential customers is to personalize your strategy based on your unique customer behavior patterns, data, successes and failures. Here are two steps to get you started: </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>SWOT Analysis:</b></span> A SWOT analysis is a strategic planning method used to determine the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of a business venture or project. It is also an integral part of a marketing strategy.<img id="img-1333375129730" src="/Portals/123780/images/inbound%20marketing%20strategy-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="inbound marketing strategy resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></p>
<p>Anatomy of a SWOT Analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Strengths:</strong> characteristics of the business, or project team that give it an advantage over others</li>
<li>
<strong>Weaknesses:</strong> characteristics that place that team at a disadvantage relative to others</li>
<li>
<strong>Opportunities:</strong> <em>external </em>chances to improve performance in the environment</li>
<li>
<strong>Threats:</strong> <em>external </em>elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify your marketing issues and seek solutions for your weaknesses. If there are ways to turn your Threats into Opportunities, start brainstorming ways to achieve that as seamlessly as possible. If your Threats are your competitors, we advise monitoring their behavior (strategies or tactics that imped or outdo yours).</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Determine Your Inbound Marketing Strategy: </b></span>Understanding your Weaknesses and Threats is one thing, but to strategize a plan to overcome them is quite another. Unless you are Wal-Mart or some another global force, your ability to stay afloat depends on a solid inbound marketing strategy that increases your leads and builds revenue.</p>
<p>If for example the results of your SWOT analysis identify an issue with <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/low-cost-website-design">website conversions</a>, new customer generation, or web hits, you might want to take a few hours to reevaluate your keyword strategy, Calls to actions, or landing pages. Unless you are new to inbound marketing, you probably already possess a list of target keywords you uncovered from the initial keyword reseach phase of your project. Create a list of 3-5 keywords relevant to your business based on difficulty and relevance. Create new content around these keywords and promote that content.</p>
<p>Positioning your business to be found by current and prospective customers online, your content must be optimized for search engine crawlers. There are five main on-page elements that your pages need to be found search-friendly. We wrote a whole series on<a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services"> SEO</a> recently. The five elements of SEO are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Indexable Content</li>
<li>Crawlable Link Structures</li>
<li>Targeted Keywords</li>
<li>Title Tags</li>
<li>Meta Tag Descriptions                                                                                                                                             </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Create Extraordinary Content Around Your Determined Strategy: </b></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any marketing strategy is only as good as the content you use to convey it. What that means is that it is possible to have a rocking inbound marketing strategy and poorly execute it. The more unique, extraordinary, and thought provoking your content is, the more it will spread which equals more traffic and more leads for your business. When it comes to content creation and representation, <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/129614/Why-Brands-Should-Use-Visual-ly-to-Create-Infographics" title="Infographics  " target="_self">Infographics</a> are the latest craze. They are in essence, data visualization, and when done well and promoted in the right fashion can be a very powerful marketing tool.  Whether you choose to create an infographic, run a contest, or create a simple blog post, try to make each piece of content it's own masterpiece.</p>

      <title>4 Ways to Align Your Sales and Marketing to Drive More Business </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1333584779287" src="/Portals/123780/images/smarketing-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="smarketing" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">Sales and marketing are no doubt the bread and butter of any businesses revenue generation. Hubspot refers to this partnership between sales and marketing as Smarketing, a term coined by Dan Tyre. Even without the nifty title, it isn’t hard to understand the necessary collaboration of the sales and marketing teams to drive leads continuously over time using a variety of techniques. In this blog, we will show you four ways to get your smarketing crew on the road to successful synchronicity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>1.    </b><b>Open the Lines of Communication</b><b> </b></span></p>
<p>It is a no brainer that sales and marketing teams should work together in harmony, but you would be shocked at how many companies operate with internal silos. The first step to achieving smarketing synchronicity is to actually get these two groups communicating and meeting on a regular basis. It is impossible to expect this type of communication to happen organically. </p>
<p>As leader of your company, take charge by organizing an initial Smarketing meeting with both teams. If your company is large, it may be best to conduct a retreat to make sure everyone is well acquainted. Make sure both sides are aware of what campaigns or projects the other has in play.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>2.    </b><b>Share Reports and Data</b></span></p>
<p>At your retreat or meeting (whichever you decide), include a presentation that analyzes recent sales and marketing data from the current quarter. Examine lead sources, sales data, and marketing campaigns. Account for where the revenue is coming from. Pick apart the sales funnel. Leave no stone unturned. Every sales and marketing rep needs to understand how the business stays afloat, so there is no doubt about which efforts need to be duplicated, further supported, or eliminated.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>3.    </b><b>Develop a Sales Level Agreement and STICK TO IT</b></span></p>
<p>On this last point, we couldn’t agree with Hubspot more. The best way to hold both the sales and marketing teams accountable for their actions and responsibilities is developing a sales and marketing SLA that clearly outlines everyone’s duties. Hubspot outlines <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5885/Improving-Sales-and-Marketing-Alignment-The-Marketing-and-Sales-SLA.aspx">5 steps to establishing a sales and marketing SLA</a>, so do your research and follow accordingly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b> </b><b>4.    </b><b>Track Your Progress in the Cloud</b></span></p>
<p>It’s easy to say you are going to do something, but never follow through. It’s even easier to direct your employees to follow through and lose track of if they are doing it or not. The best way to not get caught up in micro-mananging your crew is to require the heads of the sales and marketing team to track their progress in some type of Cloud system. Google has a number of tools like Google docs and calendar that make group collaboration simple and most importantly - FREE.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these four steps have helped you understand what Smarketing is and how you can get your sales and marketing teams working together. If you need help working on your SLA agreement, organizing a retreat/meeting, or anything else, as always, you can reach out to us.</p>

      <title>How to Generate Positive Online Reviews for Local Businesses</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Studies show that customers have browse the Internet for price matching and customer reviews before ever stepping foot into a business to make a purchase. This is old news to savvy Internet marketers, but the overwhelmed business owner may not have time to take fully appreciate the gravity of this type of customer behavior. By failing to establish a strong online presence and generate positive online reviews, local business owners have lost sales and positioned their competition to champion future sales. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>How do we know this shift in customer behavior to be true?</b></span> <a href="http://searchengineland.com/study-72-of-consumers-trust-online-reviews-as-much-as-personal-recommendations-114152">Search Engine Land</a> wrote a blog on March 12 citing startling results from the Local Consumer Review Survey, which was conducted between January 15 – March 1, 2012. </p>
<ul>
<li>The results show that 65% of consumers read between 2-10 reviews and just 7% of consumers read more than 20 reviews.</li>
<li>58% of consumers trust a business, which has positive online reviews.</li>
<li>52% of consumers are more likely to use a business if they have positive reviews, whereas just 28% of consumers cite location/price as main decision-making factors.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>What This Data Means for Local Business</b></span></p>
<p>Essentially, local business owners should be paying attention to external customer review sites like Yelp, Google Reviews, etc. Ignoring what is said about you in the public domain is detrimental to your business. Thankfully, Yelp and Google both offer guidelines to help business owners understand appropriate behavior when interacting with reviewers. Ultimately, business owners or marketers must decide how they want to handle negative reviews, as well as positive. We repeat: ignoring is NOT an option.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>How to Generate Positive Reviews</b></span></p>
<p>Positive reviews cast your business in a favorable light to prospective customers who are choosing from an ever-growing list of competitors. In order to make sure your business is in the running for today’s Internet savvy consumer, owners must implement a system of responding, incentivizing, and generating in-house reviews.<b> </b></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Establish Your Yelp or Google Places Page</b></span></p>
<p>If you have not yet taken the time to start a Yelp page for your business, input your name into the search field on Yelp.com to see if your customers beat you to it. Chances are that at least one person has reviewed your business online using Google or Yelp. If not, set up your Yelp page and Google places page, so that customers can see your business online in search results. Do your best to fully complete your Yelp page with all your business information, photos, bio, and videos. The more content you provide, the more information consumers have to base their purchasing decision.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Promote Your Pages</b></span></p>
<p>To get people to start writing reviews you must encourage them by promoting your pages through the following means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your personal and business email signature</li>
<li>Post announcement of page on Facebook and Twitter</li>
<li>Send email campaign</li>
<li>Post icons linking back to reviews pages on your business website</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Create Incentives for Posting Positive Reviews</b></span></p>
<p>It would be unethical to pay people, customers or not, to write positive reviews for your business. Whether you believe it or not, consumers are good at deciphering between real and fake/planted reviews. Yelp is hip to this as well and even designed their system to filter a certain number of positive and negative reviews just to be on the safe side. Would you even trust a business that had all 5 stars and nothing but glowing reviews? The skeptic in us doesn’t think so. </p>
<p>Instead of faking reviews, try encouraging your customers to write positive reviews by offering incentives. Reasonable incentives. A great way to make sure you are being fair and cost effective is by implementing a customer reward program. Offer points for posting reviews to Facebook, Yelp, and Google. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Generate In-House Reviews</b></span></p>
<p>Don’t just spend all your time pushing customers to write positive reviews on external sites. Show your own website some love by showcasing the most positive reviews on your website. Be sure to ask customers if it is okay to share their reviews on your website. Place a stack of comment cards in your waiting room or by the checkout counter. Give customers AND employees rewards for participating in the in-house review program and you will yield better results.</p>
<p>It is more realistic to have a mix of positive and negative reviews. You cannot please every single customer. Someone is bound to have a complaint. The best way to deal with complaining and happy customers is by responding quickly, offering incentives, and keeping the lines of communication open.</p>

      <title>4 SEO Optimization Tips for Infographics</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1332130489720" src="/Portals/123780/images/SEO-Infographic-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="SEO Infographic resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">If you have ever made the connection between infographics and <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="search engine optimization" target="_self">search engine optimization</a>, you were on the right track. Infographics spread like wildfire on the Internet.</p>
<p>Infographics are also an easy way to build links, which is why they are great for search engine optimization. Every time an infographic is shared online, a link is created back to the infographic and the originating site. SEO should be integrated in infographic development from the start to get the maximum value.</p>
<p>Here are four tips to optimizing your infographic for search engines:</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Use SEO keywords in the infographic title</b></span></p>
<p>Titles are the first thing people read before deciding to click on a link. Be sure to use your targeted keyword list when coming up with your infographic title. If you use your SEO targeted keywords in your title, your infographic will rank in search engines. Bloggers who link to your infographic in their articles will likely use your keyword-loaded title as their anchor text. When readers share your infographic online, your keyword-loaded title will get more mileage and SEO value.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Add social media share buttons on the landing page</b></span></p>
<p>To encourage readers to share your infographic online, you must place social media share buttons strategically on the landing page. Whether you choose to put them directly under the title or on the left or right side, make sure you include a <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/119271/5-Ways-for-Businesses-to-Get-Started-on-Pinterest" title="Pinterest  " target="_self">Pinterest </a>button. Infographics are images that can be pinned, so pin your heart out.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Submit to infographic social media sites and directories</b></span></p>
<p>In order to really get your infographic to build links, you have to manually push it to the right outlets. Infographic specific social media sites, as well as web directories, are good places to plant your seed. Others in your industry will be interested in your infographic for content and aesthetic reasons. It is also a good idea to add it to Facebook and Twitter to get your followers and fans in on the fun. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Develop industry specific infographics and share specifically on LinkedIn</b></span></p>
<p>Sharing your infographic with specific industries will add meaning and value for that particular audience. Imagine the SEO value and links you could build by tailoring an entire infographic to a specific field. Social media and <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/" title="Internet marketing" target="_self">Internet marketing</a> are the two most obvious and popular field-specific infographics. Try spicing it up by targeting some other fields that are not illustrated through infographics. Then, share your infographics with groups on LinkedIn. They will thank you for it.</p>
<p>SEO and infographics go hand in hand. The connection is natural, because infographics permanently reside online, and thus are shared there. It is important to consider link building while developing your infographic from beginning to end.

      <title>Why Brands Should Use Visual.ly to Create Infographics</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><img id="img-1331825973459" src="/Portals/123780/images/Why%20Brands%20Should%20Use%20Infographics-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Why Brands Should Use Infographics resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><p>Data visualization has been around for years, but a new startup called <a href="http://visual.ly/" title="Visual.ly" target="_self">Visual.ly</a> is changing the way brands create infographics and present data. Until Visual.ly came on the scene, the process of creating an infographic was rather cumbersome and expensive, but they have promised to be the exact opposite of that.</p>
<p>Before Visual.ly, we were all tasked with finding the data or compiling it, and hiring a graphic designer with data visualization know-how. Well, Visual.ly has simplified the entire process for brands, and individuals, to create compelling, well-designed <a href="http://visual.ly/what-is-an-infographic" title="infographics" target="_self">infographics</a> that facilitate conversation.</p>
<p>Unless you have been under a rock for the past few years, you have no doubt come across an infographic or two. Whether or not you realized what you were looking at is another story. In this blog, we will give you insight into what infographics are and why they are important for brands to use in 2012.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>What is Data Visualization?</b></span></p>
<p>Data visualization is simply what it sounds like – a graphic that displays complex data (numbers, words, or ideas) in a visual way. When you take data and put it into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and present it in charts and graphs that is data visualization.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>What are Infographics?</b></span></p>
<p>They are a more swanky form of data visualization. There is usually a flow or theme to the way infographics are presented. If you have ever seen a graph designed with MS Excel or a similar product, you know it cannot compare to the visual power of an infographic. Visual.ly defines the elements of an infographic as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualizations that present complex information quickly and clearly</li>
<li>Visualizations that integrate words and graphics to reveal information, patters or trends</li>
<li>Visualizations that are easier to understand than words alone</li>
<li>Visualizations that are beautiful and engaging </li>
</ul>
<p>They go into deal about the <a href="http://visual.ly/history-of-data-visualization" title="history of infographics" target="_self">history of infographics</a>, so if you’d like to do more research before you dive in, feel free to do so. What separates infographics from other forms of data visualization is the storytelling and graphically stimulating element.</p>
<p>So with all this talk about data visualization, infographics and Visual.ly, you are probably wondering what Visual.ly IS exactly. Visual.ly allows you to create your own visualizations, promote your work, and explore the work of others in the community.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Why Infographics are a Must-Have for Brands</b></span></p>
<p>Explaining processes or telling stories to consumers who have short attention spans is a near impossibility in this day and age. Brands can barely get consumers to stay seated and focused for a 1:30 YouTube video, let alone get them to actually read a story. Infographics possess a great storytelling ability that is cloaked in beautiful design. They are a great way to explain complex and/or boring details to a wide range of audiences. Everyone can appreciate a little color and well-crafted imagery to go along with their story. If brands truly want to captivate and capture the attention of consumers in 2012, they will get on the infographic bandwagon quickly. <a href="http://visual.ly/" title="Visual.ly  " target="_self">Visual.ly </a>seems to be the most inexpensive and least burdensome way to get there.</p>

      <title>Small Business SEO 6: How Content Directly Affects Website Rankings</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1331752553501" src="/Portals/123780/images/seo%20content%20improves%20ranking-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="seo content improves ranking resized 600" width="330" height="330" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">One of the most common suggestions repeated by those who are familiar with how search engines work is that "content is KING!"  Your website must have “quality content” in order to attract visitors. This has always been the case, but after the Panda update, the range and scope of your content must offer something really unique and valuable in order to maintain good rankings. It’s no longer good enough to give boring, bland descriptions of your company, or simply make do with a brief listing of products. The one thing that your site must do now is be right on target with appealing to search visitors looking for high value and relevant information. Not only must the content on your website’s pages be engaging to visitors, but it also must have credibility.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ad0000;">Why People Link to Some Sites and Not Others</span></h2>
<p>For a long time, links have been integral to boosting site rankings, and that is still true today – although, the algorithms that determine which links provide the most value has become a lot more sophisticated. In order for your site to have a fighting chance of increasing its rank, it must be one that gets people excited to spread your URL around to others. This means, a person can visit your site and want to share the information you provide with their blog readers. So, they make a post that references your content and include a live link that goes back to your site. This is called an incoming link. Readers of that blog post will click on that link and visit your site. This is great, because that means your website receives free targeted traffic. A few of these readers may also have websites or visit forums and feel compelled to share your content with even more people. Eventually, the links will snowball and soon your site has moved up rapidly onto page one of Google.</p>
<p>Okay, now let’s look at the opposite example. Let’s say that you’ve got a snazzy looking site, but the content leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn’t offer much in the way of uniqueness and visitors quickly become bored and leave. Since the content doesn’t provide enough value in their opinion, they are not inspired to share your site link with others. This quickly leads to low rankings and online irrelevancy. Obviously, this isn’t where you want your business site to be.</p>
<p>So, the challenge is to figure out ways in which your site content can engage visitors right away and offer them a reason to think highly about the information you provide.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/content%20and%20seo-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="content and seo ranking" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ad0000;">Attracting Buyers</span></h2>
<p>Every business wants to attract buyers. The secret is to offer your target customer exactly what they are looking to buy at the exact moment they wish to buy it. This sounds easy, but many business sites do not adequately know how to create content that presents their product or service in the best light to inspire a person to click the buy button, or make an appointment. Make sure you give people a reason to buy from you. What makes you different from your competitors? Why should they spend money on your widgets? People like to feel a connection to a brand or product and you need to find out how to reach out and connect to potential buyers. The more that your content informs, helps and engages visitors, the more links and buzz it will attract.</p>

      <title>Top 5 Pay Per Click Mistakes Commonly Made</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/top%20ppc%20mistakes-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="top pay per click mistakes" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">It takes time to understand the ins and outs of PPC advertising. There are many elements involved in creating a successful PPC campaign whether you are using Google, Facebook, or some other platform. Whether you are an inexperienced marketer or are well-versed in the field, the following five PPC mistakes are worth noting and avoiding. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b><span></span>Weak copywriting</b></span> – Weak copywriting is one of the biggest PPC offenses committed by inexperienced marketers. No, you do not need to have a degree in creative writing to craft an engaging, convincing call to action that holds people’s attention. </p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Under-budgeting</b></span> – Paying per day can get expensive if your copywriting is strong enough to encourage people to click on your ad. In order to achieve high conversion figures there must be enough money in your account. Whether you are using Google Adwords Express or Facebook ads, this fact remains the same. Move your budget to the recommended price and you will see an increase in your click rates.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Linking to your homepage</b></span> – Great copywriting and the right budget is not the only thing that ensures conversions. After you have drawn them in with your prose and have a big enough budget set, customers click on your ad. Where does it take them? If you are sending customers to your homepage, you are probably seeing a huge drop off in your analytics. Homepages are overwhelming and are a poor choice to link to from PPC ads. Create an optimized landing page specific to each PPC ad that continues the story started in the ad copy. Strategic call to actions will properly lead customers directly to the desired action.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Not pausing wasteful keywords</b></span> – Typically ppc campaigns are wasteful in the beginning, but if you are tracking conversions and optimizing campaigns regularly you should be able to pinpoint keywords that convert at a low enough price to give you a good return on your ad spend.  One big mistake we see that will absolutely kill your profit is not pausing keywords that don't convert and therefore are wasting money.  Pause those suckers and ramp up the money to the ones that convert and you will see a big difference in the way your campaign performs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Not knowing when to fold em and hire a PPC management service</b></span> – It takes a while to learn the tricks of the PPC trade. You may or may not catch on. This blog identifies the top four PPC mistakes, but it is not by any means a lesson in PPC ad management. It takes time, research, and trial and error to learn how to properly manage a PPC ad campaign. If you’ve tried a few different PPC ad campaigns on different platforms and you still are not seeing the conversion rates or click-throughs you want, it is time to hire a professional. Yes, there is a cost associated with hiring a management service, but those costs will be paid for when your business increases in revenue. Accept your limitations before you have successfully turned your customers off from clicking on your ads altogether.</p>

      <title>How to Be Social on LinkedIn for B2B Marketing</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>LinkedIn is a proven channel to drive traffic to your website and network with other business leaders in a variety of fields. You don’t need a bevy of marketing research to tell you this, just take a gander at the traffic sources from your web analytics. Whether or not you have tapped into the full potential of your LinkedIn account is the only factor prohibiting you from seeing the same results as other B2B marketers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>LinkedIn Grows Revenue Faster Than Apple &amp; Facebook (infographic)</b></span></p>
<p>Just in case you don’t want to take our word for it or you don’t currently have any analytics to support this claim, here is some <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/27/tech-company-revenue-growth/">marketing research</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/LinkedIn%20Grows%20Revenue-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="LinkedIn Grows Revenue resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Identify Heavy Hitters and Possible Leads</b></span></p>
<p>Similar to using Twitter for B2B marketing, it is vital to find the ACTIVE people who matter to your business and connect with them.  Active is the operational word from that last sentence. What good would it do to connect with businesses who do not have active profiles? You guessed it, none. Once you have identified people who could turn into leads, analyze their profile and activity. Find some common ground to interact with them on.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Join Groups Based on Industry &amp; Geography – GET ACTIVE</b></span></p>
<p>Groups are the best common ground on LinkedIn for making first impressions and connections. Start searching for groups based on the industry type, topic, and location. Find groups that your idenfitied heavy hitters are members of and join those too.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #800000;">Answer &amp; Pose LinkedIn Questions Routinely</span></b></p>
<p>If you want people to know how knowledgeable you are without seeming overly pushy and sales like, just offer answers to questions posed by individuals in the Question/Answer section or group message board. If people are not asking questions you feel comfortable answering, pose your own questions and see how the group responds OR get another person from your company to pose the question and you answer it. </p>
<p>It is totally possible to break through the noise on LinkedIn and become social with people who matter to your bottomline. In order to harness the full potential of LinkedIn, you must be more strategic with the way you interact with other businesses. LinkedIn, like any other social network, requires that you actually NETWORK see a real impact. LinkedIn is vital for B2B social media marketing, so we strongly behoove you to join the movement. </p>

      <title>5 Things Brands Should Know About Facebook Timeline Brand Pages</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><img id="img-1330961060334" src="/Portals/123780/images/Facebook-timeline-brand-pages-cover-design-ideas-fan-pages_F-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="Facebook timeline brand pages cover design ideas fan pages F resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><p>Last Wednesday, Facebook dropped a bomb on brands and marketers that we all knew was eventually coming our way. As early as March 30, fan pages will automatically switch over to the new Timeline format. Until then, brands can preview the new look and prepare a social media content strategy that best fits this layout.</p>
<p>The new features greatly impact the way brands engage with fans and change branding options. Prior planning will prevent poor performance, so take the time to do your research and be ready for March 30. Here is how.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>New Look Makes Posts, Images &amp; Videos Pop</b></span></p>
<p>Similar to the Timeline for personal profiles, the Brand Timeline features a huge cover photo at the top of the Page, which is complimented by a smaller profile picture that would be perfect for your logo. This bold imagery immediately demands the attention of Fans. On top of that, images and videos appear much larger than they do on the current Page.<b> </b></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Pin Tool Highlights Featured Content</b></span></p>
<p>Keeping the post you want at the top of your Page is easier now that Facebook introduced the Pin tool. It allows content to be pinned to the top of the Timeline and the story becomes bigger. Of course, you can only Pin one story at a time. If after 7 days you have not pinned a new post, Facebook automatically removes the pin for you.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Goodbye Default Landing Page</b></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, that tricked out landing page you spent so much time, effort, and money on will soon be no more. Facebook savvy brands quickly jumped on the opportunity to have a branded landing page, but this won’t be included in the Timeline update. As an alternative, we recommend utilizing the abovementioned pin tool to control what content stays at the top of your Timelines. Also, start using Facebook ads to funnel fans to certain stories where you have accounted a new promotion or milestone.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Receive Messages From Users</b></span></p>
<p>Users can now send messages directly to you. This is great for forming deeper engagement instances, managing damage control, and filtering unwanted content from your Timelines. </p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>Concealed Tabs and Apps </b></span></p>
<p>The new layout completely removes the left menu tabs and cuts back on the number of tabs and applications visible under the cover image. Don’t freak out. From what we have learned, applications are not going away. Facebook has changed the way you get to them. You can now switch up which tabs are visible directly under the cover image. Now only three tab panels are viewable. To see the others, you can expand the tab panel by clicking the drop-down box.</p>
<p>It is clear that there are pros and cons of the new Timeline, but at least brands have a month to figure things out. If you need help figuring out how to clean up your Timeline, let us know and we’ll come to the rescue.</p>

      <title>Small Business SEO 5: How To Perform Basic Keyword Research</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1330698862701" src="/Portals/123780/images/basic%20keyword%20research-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="basic keyword research resized 600" width="418" height="278" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">At the heart and soul of every search engine inquiry is a group of words known as keywords. These “key” word choices are usually a phrase that closely relates to what an individual web surfer most wishes to know at that particular time. For instance, someone looking online for a low cost paper shredder might use the keywords “cheap paper shredder.” Someone interested in a high quality shredder where cost is not a major concern might use a term like “best office paper shredder.” These keywords instantly tell the search engine what content is needed, and it provides the surfer with the top 10 most relevant websites that are directly related to that term.</p>
<p>In order for your website to benefit from the most traffic, you need to know exactly which terms related to your site’s main theme that are being searched for the most. This means you need to conduct keyword research. Finding good keywords can be done by using a variety of different tools. <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" title="Google keyword tool" target="_self">Google keyword tool</a> is one of the best tools out there and guess what... It's FREE.  All you need to do is type in your main broad keyword and do a search. Depending on your keyword, Google will bring back numerous keywords that may or may not be relevant to your business.  Choose the ones that are most relevant and group them by theme, so that you can later create separate pages of content on your site for each theme you've chosen. The more keyword specific and targeted the content on your pages are, the more likely you will rank highly for those keywords and more visitors will find your pages.</p>
<p>While looking at a big list of keywords, you’ll need to determine which ones are searched the most. These will bring you the most but not necessarily the highest converting traffic. You want to make sure your meta tags, header tags, image alt tags, and content are correctly optimized for these terms. There will also be some secondary keywords that are closely related to your main terms that can also be sprinkled throughout the content on the page.</p>
<p>Does simply putting a keyword on your page mean you’ll instantly get lots of traffic?</p>
<p>No. Some further analysis of the keyword term is needed to determine how much direct competition it has already. The more popular keywords are going to be the ones used by a large number of online sites. If there are several sites listed in the top search results that are using a keyword you want to target, it will be more difficult for your site to rank for that term. Aged sites that have lots of backlinks and are already enjoying good traffic for your target keyword are not going to be easy to outrank because they have won authority for that term.  Two great tools for determing how competitive a keyword phrase will be are SEOMoz's <a href="http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/" title="Open Site Explorer" target="_self">Open Site Explorer</a> to analyze the backlinks of your competitors and also their <a href="http://pro.seomoz.org/tools/keyword-difficulty/" title="Keyword Difficulty tool" target="_self">Keyword Difficulty tool</a> takes into account several ranking factors and is great for giving you an idea of just how hard it will be to rank for that keyword.  Depending on your niche some of these high traffic keywords would take way too long to rank for if you start targeting them from the get go.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/basic%20seo%20keyword%20research-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="basic seo keyword research resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>However, there are always alternative keywords that you can find that have a lot less competition. These types of keywords are called “Long Tail” because they normally include three or more words. In fact, <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/63236/Guide-For-Improving-Google-Ranking-Longtail-Keyword-Strategy" title="long tail keywords" target="_self">long tail keywords</a> can be pretty lucrative, even if they get way less traffic than common terms. Long tail keywords tend to be much more specific, which means the person is seriously looking for that exact thing. A lot of buyers also use these type of terms because they’ve already done their research and are ready to make a purchase. For instance, “best digital camera” is replaced by a more specific term like “Cannon Powershot Digital Camera”.</p>
<p>Keyword research is a tedious and time consuming task, but is absolutely essential for obtaining quality targeted traffic that will convert to actual dollars in your pocket.</p>

      <title>How to Optimize Blog Headlines</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Whether you are writing for web or print, headlines are a great way to grab the reader’s attention. Nevertheless, even the most experienced copywriters find writing headlines to be one of the most taxing elements of writing.  </p>
<p>In order for blog writing to be an effective search engine optimization and content marketing technique, you must carefully craft headlines that are clear and, if you can manage it, clever.   <br>In this blog, we will outline the elements of writing headlines for web copy using search engine optimization techniques. We will also differentiate the main differences between writing for print vs. the web.   <br><b></b></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Writing for the Web</b></span> <br><b> </b> <br>The rumor about print publications is that they will one day, very soon, be obsolete. With the advent of laptops, tablets, and e-readers, we have all become accustomed to getting our information through some type of electronic device. Fewer publishers are investing their marketing budgets in printing material, because readers prefer the ease of getting their daily dose of news, gossip, or entertainment from a screen instead of print form.  </p>
<p>This is great news for marketers and SEO consultants, because content marketing on the Web is faster and cheaper than any print campaign could ever be. However, writing for the web presents challenges that have plagued copywriters for years. Changing your style to fit the web instead of print is a hard habit to learn, but it is possible once you know what to do.  </p>
<p>Web users have short attention spans, so you should not overwhelm them with large blocks of content. Break your information into chunks of related material that can be easily assessed.This way, your content will have a better chance of resonating with the reader.  </p>
<p>Large blocks of content can scare away your readers in the first few seconds of visiting your site. On average, users spend around 4 seconds for every extra 100 words on a page. Check your Google Analytics data to see which pages users drop off your site on. This could be an indicator that your content is overwhelming.   <br><b></b></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Conquering Headlines</b> </span></p>
<p>Headlines can either assist and ease the reading experience or make it slow and painful. Here are a few tips that can get you on the road to writing great headlines. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b><span style="color: #800000;">Focus on keywords that tell the story</span>.</b> We hear the term “keyword” over and over in this industry and that is because they are important. Using consistent keywords throughout your content can help boost your rank in search engines for those terms and helps your reader remember the main points you are trying to drive home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Use keywords in your headlines, titles, meta tags, etc.</b></span> Take your keywords and use them to further optimize your content. Make sure you don't overdo it and cause your copy to appear like a sales pitch, because it will turn readers off. Use your keywords appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Make headlines teaser or benefit-oriented</b>.</span> A teaser headline literally pulls you into reading the copy. Use a play on words, joke, or riddle. These are risky unless done right. If you are not a naturally witty person or cannot translate your wittiness into words, do not try teaser headlines. Benefit-oriented headlines are a much safer bet. They clearly state what the value and main benefit of the offer is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><b>Use the words <em>how to, </em>customer testimonial, list the offer or reasons why. </b></span>Either of these tactics is an effective way to generate headlines ideas. Write a few example headlines to practice and be sure to include your keywords in areas where they are appropriate and able to rank in search engines.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Content Marketing for B2B: How To Amp Up Your Web Presence</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Over the past few years, more marketers have started to embrace content marketing as a viable strategy to rank higher in search engines and gain popularity among Internet users. Big brands like Coca-Cola and Mint are already knee deep in content marketing campaigns, because they see the benefit in creating unique and inspiring content for the masses to consume.</p>
<p>Content that educates, informs, and entertains can drive traffic and most importantly, creates long-lasting and loyal viewers who will (fingers crossed) develop into customers over time. According to the infographic*, 60% of B2B marketers plan to spend more on content marketing in 2012 and 90% are already doing some form of content marketing. That same research shows that 79% of B2B marketers are involved in article posting as a means of content marketing.</p>
<p>Before we can get into the nitty gritty of content marketing, we must first clearly define it, so you understand WHAT you should do, not just WHY you should do it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><b>What Is Content Marketing?</b></span></p>
<p>In “<a href="http://blog.junta42.com/2007/07/the-ultimate-co/">The Five Pillars of Content Marketing</a>,” Joe Pulizzi defines Content Marketing as…</p>
<ul>
<li>“<span style="color: #990000;"><b><em>Editorial-based </em></b></span>(or long-form) content. It must tell a relevant, valuable story. Must be informative, educational or entertaining.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b><em>Marketing-backed</em></b></span><em>.</em> The content has underlying marketing and sales objectives that a corporation, association or institution is trying to accomplish.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b><em>Behavior-driven</em></b></span><em>.</em> Seeks out to maintain or alter the recipient’s behavior.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b><em>Multi-platform.</em></b></span><b> </b>(print, digital, audio, video, events). It can be, does not have to be, integrated.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b><em>Targeted</em></b></span><em> </em>toward a specific audience. If you can’t name the audience, it’s not content marketing.”<b></b>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><b>What Makes a Good Content Marketing Strategy?</b></span></p>
<p>We found an amazing infographic* that describes the make-up of a good content marketing strategy for businesses. According to the infographic, a good content strategy is quality, shareable content.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola’s Content 20/20 Campaign is a perfect example of how business can create a good and "liquid" content marketing strategy.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="315" id="img-1329749243966" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LerdMmWjU_E" width="560"></iframe>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><b>What are the Most Used Content Marketing Tactics?</b></span></p>
<p>As content marketing is a form of marketing, it must be aligned with measurable goals that are accomplished through tactics. The Content Marketing Institute released “<a href="http://www.contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/B2B_Content_Marketing_2012.pdf">B2B Content Marketing: 2012 Benchmarks, Budgets &amp; Trends</a>,” a report on their findings related to content marketing. In it, they identify article posting (79%), social media (74%), blogs (65%), eNewsletter (63%), case studies (58%), and in-person events (56%) as the most effective content marketing tactics used by B2B marketers. </p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>What are the LEAST Used Content Marketing Tactics?</strong></span></p>
<p>One or two of the tactics that made the 'least used' list were a bit surprising. They are: Ebooks (16%), podcasts (16%), mobile content (15%), digital magazines (14%), and virtual conferences (10%). Ebooks and virtual conferences ranked surprisingly low. However, there are many B2B marketers who have success with these two tactics. As a B2B marketer, I find loads of value in ebooks and virtural conferences, but to be quite honest, it is not a tactic for the inexperienced. So, leave that to the pros who have mass appeal. </p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Content Marketing Take-Away</strong></span></p>
<p>To conclude a long story, content marketing is the way of the future for B2B marketers. The best thing you can do is figure out which content marketing tactics will work for your business and come up with application methods. If you are unsure about how to move forward with your new content strategy, give us a ring and we can help you brainstorm ways to get the ball rolling. </p>

      <title>Small Business SEO 4: How To Make Your Website Search Engine Friendly</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/make%20a%20website%20search%20engine%20friendly-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="make a website search engine friendly resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">If you are at all interested in having your website be found by people online, you need to devote some time and attention to optimizing your site for the search engines. There are five main on-page elements that your site needs in order to be search friendly: Indexable Content, Crawlable Link Structures, Targeted Keywords, Title Tags and Meta Tag Descriptions.</p>
<h2>Indexable Content</h2>
<p>If you have decided to have a website designed that includes lots of Flash, Java code, images, video, etc. One of the drawbacks to having this type of content dominate the site is that the search engines simply can’t read what’s going on. To the human eye, this stuff looks great, but it literally makes your site’s content invisible to search spiders. Therefore, to correct this, you need to add a significant amount of HTML friendly content that is able to be deciphered.</p>
<h2>Crawlable Link Structures</h2>
<p>When the search spiders come to your online neighborhood and spot your site, they will latch onto the index page and crawl its content. This is a necessary step that allows your content to be scooped up and added into the search index database. Once it is done crawling that page, it will seek out links on the page that lead to other pages. A link is like leaving a door open for the spider to enter and explore the next room.</p>
<p>This is why it’s very important that you make sure that your site has a properly set up link structure that makes it easy for spiders to find all of the pages on your site. If there is no page link available, the spider will not be able to crawl additional pages.</p>
<h2>Targeted Keywords</h2>
<p>While site content should be friendly and easy-to-read for your site visitors, another thing it must contain that is important to search are keywords. Keywords are a combination of word phrases that the typical online web surfer uses to find information of high interest. You need to conduct some research into what types of keywords your potential customers are regularly using and make a list.</p>
<p>After you have gathered up your list of targeted keywords, you want to have them inserted seamlessly into the pages of your website. This can be done by a skilled website content writer that is familiar with <a href="/seo-checklist-for-small-business/" title="SEO" target="_self">SEO</a> keyword copy. One thing to be aware of is that you don’t want your keywords to be too general. For instance, someone searching for blue copy paper is looking for a very specific type of paper. If you sell paper and do not include this <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/63236/Guide-For-Improving-Google-Ranking-Longtail-Keyword-Strategy" title="long-tail keyword" target="_self">long-tail keyword</a>, but stick with the general term “paper,” your site will not attract the most optimal customers for your business.</p>
<h2>Title Tags</h2>
<p>Every page of your site should include a strong title tag that explains to visitors (and search engines) exactly what your page content is about. Title tags normally appear at the very top of an Internet browser, regardless of which browser is used. These tags show up in search results, so wording is important. Keywords can enhance title tags and should always be added at the front for best results.  Keeping this all in mind you still want people to click your link, so make you title tags interesting to the searcher so that they visit your site instead of your competitors.</p>
<h2>Meta Tag Descriptions</h2>
<p>Meta tag descriptions are not used to assist a site’s ranking in search engines. However, they do play an important role in search listings. The content includes a brief description of your website and can be useful for enticing people to visit your website. When someone does a search, they will usually read your Title Tag and Meta Description first.</p>

      <title>How B2B Companies Build Social Media Reach</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1329251805685" src="/Portals/123780/images/Social-Media-Reach-Serengeti-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="Social Media Reach Serengeti resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Many social media marketers have little to say in the way of B2B social media marketing. Some will even say it cannot be done. Well, <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com">SearchDog Marketing</a> is here to tell you that social media success can be achieved for B2B companies! Be aware that social media strategies for B2B companies require a slightly different approach than B2C, for obvious reasons, but it is totally doable.</p>
<p>The first thing B2B social media marketers must start doing is… </p>
<p><b>Quality OVER Quantity</b></p>
<p>Instead of worrying about how many followers you have, focus on gaining a QUALITY following. How do you get quality followers, you ask? By targeting certain businesses that you want to engage. What good will 1,000 low quality followers do for your brand? Little. Examine your competitors follower lists and follow those companies too.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this strategy is more than snatch and grab. You must find the other businesses that you want to target and engage them. The average, everyday citizen, fan or follower may not do you any good, so think about your bottom line. </p>
<p><b>Share Content with Complementary Businesses</b></p>
<p>Not too long ago, we started something called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/searchdogmarketing">Friday Local Business Spotlight</a> on Facebook. It is just what it sounds like – every Friday we feature a new Atlanta business that we fancy for whatever reason. The concept is simple enough – we shine some light on a complementary, local business in hopes of…. what exactly? In hopes of making a connection and expanding our social media reach. How much ROI have we gained from it? It depends on what you (we) call success. Success, for us, in this sense, is making a social connection on and offline with the business. We’re using social media as a tool, a means to an end. </p>
<p>Not only do we spotlight businesses, we also share their share-worthy content with our followers and fans. Everything is not all about us and we not only understand that, we embrace it. Social media is about two-way communication, sharing ideas, inspiration, and information. In essence, be social with other businesses and they will likely return the favor. </p>
<p><b>Integrate Social Media Intro Traditional Marketing Mix</b></p>
<p>Social media is only a piece of the marketing mix that keeps your business reach growing systematically over time. Although social media management can be rather taxing and time-consuming, it is important not to forget to keep up with what you are already doing and integrate the new with the old. Some things are obsolete and no longer necessary. Technology and the Internet has allowed businesses to cut corners and save costs on things that were once big financial burdens. Social media, for instance, is a free (primarily) tool that you can use to your advantage. </p>
<p>Different businesses use social media for different marketing functions. Some use it as event promotion, customer service, public relations, or advertising. Some use it for all of that and more. No matter what your reason is for using social media for B2B marketing, remember not to put all your eggs in the social media basket. Doing so is just as risky in social media as it is in life and business.</p>

      <title>SEO For Business #3: 2 Big SEO Mistakes Which May Hurt Your Rankings</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1329154461897" src="/Portals/123780/images/seo-mistakes-resized-600.gif" border="0" alt="seo mistakes" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">A business website is more than just a collection of pages in cyberspace that highlights your products and services. It’s also a promotional tool that works to gain attention for your business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is the easiest online contact that a person searching for what you offer is going to have with your company. Maybe you have spent good money having your website designed and it looks spiffy. However, you have noticed that it isn’t producing the kind of visitors you thought it would.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Well, the usual answer is that many people simply cannot find your site. As you learned earlier, each website page is assigned a specific ranking by the search engines. First page rankings are the most desired, because they attract the majority of surf traffic. But, unfortunately, most websites are not going to be able to claim one of those coveted spots on their own. Your website pages may be lingering way back in the crowd on page 10 or 27 or 52. If this is the case, there is no way that it will attract the kind of premium traffic filled with buyers who are ready to spend their money.</p>
<h2>2 Major SEO Mistakes</h2>
<p>There are two major reasons why your site is receiving such bad rankings: Poor Indexing and Lack of Targeted Content.</p>
<h2>Poor Indexing</h2>
<p>As you have learned, search engine spiders will visit your website and crawl its pages looking for relevant information. Due to the fact that this is an automated process, there are things that can literally trip up a spider and cause it to not be able to pull the information it needs from a page to determine what your website is actually about in order to produce a suitable ranking.</p>
<p>For instance, website pages containing popular elements such as Flash, Java applets, Frames, as well as photos, images, audio or video that aren’t keyword optimized contain content that cannot be processed by search engine spiders, and therefore make determining the theme of your pages very difficult.  Be sure to optimize all image “alt tags” with your target keywords, use Flash sparingly only as added effect, and give a keyword rich text description for any audio or video on the page.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Mistakes%20in%20SEO-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="Mistakes in SEO resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Inadequate linking is another problem. Your indexed pages may have links to a few inner pages, but may have skipped linking to a large portion of your site. When a spider visits a particular page, it is also crawling any pages that are linked to that page. This type of “deep internal linking” is essential in order to make sure that all of your site pages can be found online.  A good way to tackle this issue is to have your webmaster create an xml-sitemap that has links to all of your pages and place it in the footer of all the pages on your website.  Also create a Google webmaster tools account to monitor how search engine spiders are indexing your content.</p>
<h2>Lack of Targeted Content</h2>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/common%20SEO%20mistakes-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="common SEO mistakes resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The average person is going to type in the search phrase that is most important to them. They only want to look at sites that are most targeted to their search query. If the content on your pages is not specifically optimized for the keyword being searched for or is too general in nature, the search engines may deem your site as not important enough for a top ranking.  Be sure to create separate pages for the terms you want to rank for and optimize your tags and content specifically for those phrases.</p>
<h2>SEO Marketing to the Rescue</h2>
<p>A well thought out <a href="/seo-checklist-for-small-business/" title="SEO marketing strategy" target="_self">SEO marketing strategy</a> can help you map out necessary changes to your site pages that instantly makes them more attractive to search engines. This includes making sure your website has a good internal linking structure in place and including an xml-sitemap in your footer.</p>
<p>It also includes doing a thorough evaluation of your site content, and sprucing up any weak spots by creating content that includes popular terms being searched for by your ideal customer.</p>

      <title>3 Instagram Best Practices For Brands</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>In last Thursday’s blog, we identified simple ways to beef up your social media presence. One way was to visually engage your followers with cool images by using Instagram, a hot, new application. Brands are already joining the fun and yours should too.</p>
<p>Before I jump right into the good stuff, let me warn you that Instagram is not a tool that will work for every brand under the sun. You must have a visual component to your business and it must be interesting. This works best for B2C brands that have products and services that lend themselves to photography.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Here are 3 Instagram Best Practices for Brands:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Create a Hashtag Theme – </b>The great way to organize your photos is by coming up with a way to categorize your own photos that your followers can also use. For example, if you own a coffee shop, your hashtag theme could be #cupofjoe or something else that is general enough to be broadly applied.<b></b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Interesting &amp; Consistent Posts Only – </b>The worst thing you could do as a brand is to make random, uninteresting posts on Instagram. The same way you see people using Instagram is NOT the way brands should use it. Whether you choose to post in the morning, lunchtime, evening or night, make sure you stick to consistent time frame and number of photos. Posting 15 photos at once has the potential to overwhelm your followers just as boring, unrelated photos can produce negative comments or unfollows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a Contest</strong> – getting your customers involved through a contest is a great way to generate buzz about your business. Creating a contest using Instagram is pretty simple. Just have your followers submit photos that correspond to a themed hashtag, choose a winner, and feature their photo. It’s that simple.<b> </b></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Does Instagram Hold Value for Businesses?</b></p>
<p>Honestly, it’s still too early in the game to decide whether or not Instagram has true value for businesses outside of social media engagement. Below are 3 businesses who are doing a tremendously good job of engaging followers by posting awesome content. Study their strategy and follow suit.  </p>

      <title>SEO For Business #2:  How People Use Search Engines To Find Things Online</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1328646688501" src="/Portals/123780/images/SEO%20for%20business-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="SEO for business resized 600" width="285" height="383" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">Without the search engines, the Internet would be just a jumble of sites with no rhyme or reason. The average person uses search engines to quickly find information about a particular topic or product. Because of the vastness of the web, search engines are a convenience to the average web surfer. When a keyword term is typed into the browser, up pops a row of neatly organized websites that feature a brief description of what you can expect to find on the page.</p>
<p>By now, you’ve probably heard that its important to have your site appear on the first page of Google, or any other search engine, for that matter. However, Google, in particular, is the giant when it comes to providing real time site visitors. A 2009 study done by EightFoldLogic found the following traffic facts:</p>
<h2>Number of Visitors Sending Traffic to Websites Per Major Search Engine</h2>
<p>Google accounts for 78.43% of traffic</p>
<p>Yahoo! accounts for 9.73% of traffic</p>
<p>Bing accounts for 7.86% of traffic</p>
<p>The graph below shows a more recent picture of search market share as of 2011.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/How%20people%20use%20search%20engines-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="How people use search engines resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>As you can see, this brief snapshot shows you that Google is by far the most popular search engine with people who surf online. This is why <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="SEO firms" target="_self">SEO firms</a> are most often focused on helping business websites rank highly in Google search first. It only makes sense that you need to be in front of the largest crowd. According to a study done by comScore in April of 2010, Americans alone conducted 15.5 billion searches online. Obtaining higher search rankings through SEO should be a major part of any long-term business marketing strategy.</p>
<h2>Consumers are Looking Online to Buy Stuff Offline</h2>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/SEO%20for%20small%20business-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="SEO for small business resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>One of the most fascinating (and exciting) search facts for businesses is the number of people who first do their product research online, then go to a brick and mortar location to make a purchase. In 2007, a Yahoo! study found that online advertising leads to an actual offline purchase by a 6 to 1 margin. For every $1 spent online, there were $16 spent buying products offline. This means that many consumers are visiting your website to take notes and compare the merits of what your business has to offer against your competitor. They then make a determination of how to spend their dollars.</p>
<p>Google has done some really interesting research on this stuff themselves in an ebook called, <a href="http://www.zeromomentoftruth.com/" title='"The Zero Moment Of Truth"' target="_self">"The Zero Moment Of Truth"</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, you really need to think about what exactly each potential customer is seeing when they visit each page of your website.</p>
<p>Are they seeing boring, lackluster copy? Or, snappy writing that specifically targets their interests?</p>
<p>Are they seeing tacky graphics that belong in another decade gone by? Or, are they seeing modern graphics and photos that show your products in the best light?</p>
<p>These are things you need to consider, especially if you are interested in attracting local customers. Regardless of whatever other advertising you use, ignoring your website, or taking it for granted could be costing you lots of money.</p>
<p>You see, the majority of people living in your community are searching for local products and services via search engines. In fact, in 2007, Webvisible and Nielsen conducted a survey that found:</p>
<p>86% of people said they use the Internet to find a local business</p>
<p>80% said they research products and services online before making an offline purchase</p>
<p>In order to attract as many of these potential customers as possible, you must make sure that your website is highly targeted to their immediate needs and interests.</p>

      <title>SEO For Business Part 1:  Understanding How Search Engines Work</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1328298543993" src="/Portals/123780/images/how-search-engines-work-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="how search engines work resized 600" width="360" height="216" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">Over the next few days, we're going to be breaking down how search engines like Google and Bing actually work and teach you the basics of <a href="/seo-checklist-for-small-business/" title="Search Engine Optimization" target="_self">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO).  In this 10 part series we're going to show you SEO best practices that will help you outrank 90% of your competitors on the web.  We hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>Everyone who surfs the Internet is familiar with search engines. Google being the biggest and most popular search engine out there, commands both fear and respect among anyone who chooses to put up a website. On the surface, a search engine is the portal to finding specific information about a variety of topics online. However, if you scratch beneath the surface, you’ll find that there is much more to them than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Basically, search engines have four major functions: Crawling the Web, Building an Index, Determining Relevancy and Rankings and Displaying Results. Each one of these steps is essential for sorting out information among an enormous number of website pages, and assigning each page a specific ranking based on an accumulation of many factors.</p>
<h2>Crawling the Web</h2>
<p>As of February 2012 the number of indexed websites online is around 8.52 billion. Imagine having the job of searching all of those to figure out what people really want to know. When a website is brand new, it does not automatically get found online. First, the website must be “crawled” by what is commonly called search engine “spiders” or “robots.” Each day, these automated spiders are roaming the web looking for fresh information. Once the spider discovers the new site, it will then crawl it and index all of the information. This can take days or weeks, depending on the type of <a href="/seo-checklist-for-small-business/" title="SEO" target="_self">SEO</a> activity being done for the site.</p>
<p>As for existing website pages. They are also crawled on a regular basis. However, those sites that continue to update their pages with fresh information will be crawled more often than stagnant sites. This is why it’s possible to move a site up the rankings even if it is far back in the pack. A website is not stuck with a low ranking, unless no effort is made to improve results.</p>
<h2>Building an Index</h2>
<p>One of the main jobs of a search engine is to place each website into its index. This makes it easy for surfers to find information that they need quickly. It is similar to filing a book onto a library shelf. If all of the books were scattered about, you’d never find anything of value. However, once each book has been placed on the appropriate shelf space, you can then quickly locate it under the right category.</p>
<h2>Determining Relevancy and Rankings</h2>
<p>Okay. Now that your website is indexed, that’s not the end of the story. The search engine then must determine where your site fits in with all of the other competing sites with very similar information. This is where the real battle for search engine dominance is waged. Relevancy means that the content on your site pages provides lots of specific information on a niche topic that is highly valuable to people searching on this topic. For instance, if you are searching for “ergonomic office chair” you don’t want to see a bunch of sites that talk about home furniture.</p>
<p>The search engine will make a determination as to how much relevancy your site content offers surfers and assign it a specific page ranking. By the way, each page of your site can have its own ranking.</p>
<h2>Displaying Results</h2>
<p>Once your website has been indexed and pages have rankings, they will show up as results when someone types in specific keywords. If you have done a good job of SEO on your site, you may be among the fortunate ones that have a site ranking in the top 10 results. These are the most coveted spots on the Internet.</p>

      <title>Facebook Files Paperwork to Go Public</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Yesterday, news media reported that Facebook filed paperwork for its initial public offering. The paperwork provided the first peek at the social media giant's finances since its launch 8 years ago.</p>
<img src="/Portals/123780/images/facebook%20goes%20public-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="facebook goes public resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><p>Facebook seeks to raise $5 million from investors by selling a small percentage of its shares to the public in its IPO. This would be the largest offering ever made by a technology company and easily surpasses the $1.9 million raised by Google Inc. in 2004. </p>
<p><span>The excitement among investors and the general public is mounting since yesterday's announcement. </span>Going public will likely have little to no effect on the average user, unless they plan to purchase shares. <span>CEO Mark Zuckerberg is Facebook's largest individual shareholder and controls 57 percent of the voting shares, according to the SEO filing. </span></p>
<p>Although no official date is currently set for trading to begin, Facebook wil probably make its debut on the market in three to four months. The Palo Alto, California based company hopes to list its stock under the ticket symbol, "FB," although it is unknown whether they will be on the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange. </p>
<p>We'll keep you posted as this story unfolds. </p>

      <title>5 Simple Ways to Beef Up Your Social Media Content</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<div>
<p>Does your social media presence need a content facelift? Do you consistently find yourself feeling as though your updates are stale in comparison to what your peers and competitors post? Have no fear, because you are not alone. This is a common problem for B2C social media.</p>
<p>The truth is, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to master social media, you just have to understand it. The problem for many business owners is finding the time and energy to come up with engaging content while managing to keep their business afloat. The simple solution would be to outsource your internet marketing and <a href="http://www.searchdogmarketing.com" title="social media marketing to a reliable and experienced company" target="_self">social media marketing to a reliable and experienced company</a> (insert shameless plug here). The quick and easy solution is to read and implement the 5 simple ways to beef up your social media content, which are located below.</p>
<p><span><span style="color: #993300;"><b>1)    </b><b>Embrace Your Funny Bone </b></span>–</span> Social media is not the proper arena for the uptight or easily offended crowd. Part of the attraction to sites like Facebook and Twitter is the sheer lack of censorship and prevalence of free speech. Twitter’s recent decision to block tweets and accounts comes as a disappointment, but other than that these are pretty much free speech zones. Use your freedom of speech to show the lighter, funnier side of your business. No one has ordered you take a serious approach to social media content. Your customers would enjoy it and they are more inclined to like a post that’s humorous. Besides, who doesn’t love a good laugh ever so often?</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>2)   </b><b>Be Visually Stimulating</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><img id="img-1328122020863" src="/Portals/123780/images/instagram-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Use Instagram to Create Striking Visuals" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words. Cliché, but very true. I’ve been very impressed with the way companies like Starbucks are using Instagram on Twitter. Instagram is a photo application that allows you to create interesting photo effects by adding filters. Yes, it’s another application to learn, but the possibilities are really endless if you can tap into your creative side. There is honestly nothing more boring than visiting a Facebook or Twitter page and seeing a wall with only text status updates. No pictures, no videos, no surveys or polls, just text-based status updates with a few exclamation points to liven it up. This is boring content and no one is reading it. Photos and videos are the name of the game when it comes to social media. Uploading photos to Twitter is a great way to make your profile more dynamic and capture your followers attention using something INSTEAD OF WORDS. If your customers wanted to read your words, they would email you. They’re following you on social media sites because they want to HEAR and SEE what you’re made of. So, show them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>3)   </b><b>Provide Feedback</b> </span></p>
<p>Social media is a tool for two-way communication, not mass broadcasting. There are a number of opportunities for businesses to engage in two-way communication with their target market, peers, and competitors. By engaging in two-way communication, you’re showing your followers that you care and are interested in the same things they are.</p>
<p><img id="img-1328121553412" src="/Portals/123780/images/Two%20way%20communication-resized-600.gif" border="0" alt="Two way communication resized 600" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>SEO consultants, inbound marketers, and the business community are constantly looking for answers and input on LinkedIn. This is a great opportunity to engage professionals by offering your opinion to the mix. A few weeks of consistent answering and following up will lead to more followers in LinkedIn. This strategy also transfers to Facebook groups and random Twitter posts.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>4)   </b><b>Discuss Industry News</b></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span><img id="img-1328122029016" src="/Portals/123780/images/industrynews-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="industrynews resized 600" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Reporting the latest industry news and giving your own perspective is a great way to keep the two-way conversation going. We’ve said this before, but all of your posts should not be directly related to your business. This self-centered use of social media results in a loss of interaction and followers. The next time industry news breaks, sit down at your desk and come up with a blog post. Publish it soon, if not immediately, so that it’s timely (news is nothing if not timely). Your blog subscribers and followers will appreciate your perspective being delivered to their inbox instead of having to go search for it. </p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><b>5)   </b><b>Poll the People </b></span></p>
<p><img id="img-1328122032238" src="/Portals/123780/images/poll%20the%20people-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="poll the people resized 600" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Social media is filled to the brim with opinions. Everyone has one and they are itching to share it with the world. Come up with poll topics and start polling your followers and fans at least once every two weeks. Be careful not to overdo it. Do not limit your poll topics to your industry. Create polls around social topics, popular television shows and other things that have broad appeal.<b> </b></p>

      <title>Twitter to Censor Tweets and Profiles Using New Tool</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[

<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/twitter-censorship-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="Twitter Censors Content " class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Late last week, Twitter announced plans to use a new tool to censor content in certain parts of the world, while keeping the same content visible in other countries.</p>
<p>This decision comes as a surprise to those who recall that exactly one year ago Twitter published <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2011/01/tweets-must-flow.html" title="a blog" target="_self">a blog</a> proclaiming their commitment to the freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Prior to last week’s announcement, Twitter only censored content by eliminating it from the site entirely. Some people like <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2012/01/26/twitter-commits-social-suicide/">Mark Gibbs</a> feel Twitter has committed the ultimate social sin by compromising with government leaders to censor certain content. Others speculate that this is merely a strategic move to ease their global expansion into less than democratic parts of the world. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/01/tweets-still-must-flow.html">“The Tweets Must Flow”,</a> Twitter had this to say,</p>
<p><em>“As we continue to grow internationally, we will enter countries that have different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression. Some differ so much from our ideas that we will not be able to exist there. Others are similar but, for historical or cultural reasons, restrict certain types of content, such as France or Germany, which ban pro-Nazi content.”</em></p>
<p>This is a very different tune from the one they were singing last year. They published a blog with the exact same title, except the message was very different.</p>
<p><em>“At Twitter, we have identified our own responsibilities and limits. There are Tweets that we do remove, such as illegal Tweets and spam. However, we make efforts to keep these exceptions narrow so they may serve to prove a broader and more important rule—we strive not to remove Tweets on the basis of their content.”</em></p>
<p>One thing is for sure, governments around the world are supportive. Take Thailand for instance, where censorship regulations are already in heavy rotation. The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/30/thailand-backs-twitter-censorship-policy?newsfeed=true" title="Thai government  " target="_self">Thai government </a>is the first government to publicly endorse Twitter's censorship rules. </p>
<p>U.S. Senator Joe Liberman has yet to give a public endorsement, but we presume he is especially pleased since he called for <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/12/26/twitter-taliban-lieberman/" title="Twitter to block the Taliban" target="_self">Twitter to block the Taliban</a> and affiliated accounts late last year. </p>
<p>Even though Twitter has promised to notify users if and when content is withheld, some users are not comforted and are quite outraged.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Tweet-withheld-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="Tweet withheld resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>On January 28, users planned <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/27/twitter-boycott-planned-t_n_1236573.html" title="a boycott of Twitter" target="_self">a worldwide boycott of Twitter</a> using the hashtag #TwitterBlackout. These protests come less than two weeks after Wikipedia and others blackedout their sites in protest of two controversial anti-piracy bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act. </p>
<p>We are honestly hestiant to jump to judgement here. This move toward censorship is not new to social media. It's a simple fact that if Twitter hopes to expand its global reach, it must play ball with governments to a certain degree. But how much is too much? Do you think Twitter will lose its 'street cred' with the younger generation by compromising with the government?</p>
<p>Soon after the news broke, Mashable posed this question and we're curious to know what you think. "Should Twitter make compromises with censoring governments for the sake of global expansion? Let us know if the comments if you think growing with restrictions is the right move for the microblog." </p>
<p>Let us know what you think.</p>

      <title>How To Get More Facebook "Likes" By Using Facebook Page Post Ads</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Facebook-page-post-ad-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Facebook page post ad resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Your business is having a great sale, for a limited time and you want to let <em>everyone</em> on Facebook know about it.  <em>The problem</em>: your Facebook Page only has 200 “likes.”  <em>The solution</em>: create a Facebook Page Post Ad—yes it’s a mouthful to say, but not difficult to do.</p>
<p><b>Why create a Facebook Page Post Ad</b></p>
<p>1)      Share your post with thousands users</p>
<p>2)      Target specific demographics with your ad</p>
<p>3)      Gain new “likes”</p>
<p>4)      Increase awareness of sales, promotions, etc.</p>
<p>5)      Track views, reach, clicks, and more</p>
<p>6)      Inexpensive way to advertise your business</p>
<p><b>Setting up your Facebook Page Post Ad</b></p>
<p>To get started, first login to your Facebook account that is the administrator for the Page you would like to promote.  The first step to promoting a Page Post is actually making the post on the appropriate page.  This first step is very important because your post is what everyone will see.  In essence your post is your advertisement, so spend some time creating a post that will entice users to click it. </p>
<p>Once you have made a post that you would like to promote, you can begin to create your ad.  To get started, go to your home page and click <b>Ads</b> (left hand column).</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/promoting%20facebook%20page%20posts-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="promoting facebook page posts resized 600"></p>
<p>Next Click <b>Create an Ad</b> (top right).</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Facebook%20page%20post%20ads-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Facebook page post ads resized 600"></p>
<p>Under “<b>Destination</b>” choose the appropriate Page.  <b>Type</b>-&gt;Facebook Ads, <b>Story Type</b>-&gt;Page Post Ad, <b>Page Post Selection</b>-&gt; “the post you just created.”  Under preview it will show your logo, business name, post, and allow users to like, comment, and share your post. </p>
<p><b>Targeting Your Customers</b></p>
<p>Facebook allows you to control exactly who sees your ads, which is an essential part of targeting the right users and controlling your ad spend.  If you are selling customized skate boards, you probably don’t want to target 65+ year old females.  Choose appropriate ages, gender, location, or even select to only show the ad to friends of current fans. </p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Facebook%20page%20post%20advertising-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Facebook page post advertising resized 600"></p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Creating a Facebook Page Post Ad can be a great way to share your message with a larger customer base and will help gain new “likes” for your Facebook Page.  Setting up an ad is a fairly painless process and if your ads are targeted to the correct demographic, can be very cost efficient.  I would encourage all small businesses to try out a new Facebook Page Post Ad for your next sale, promotion, or news announcement.</p>

      <title>How to Create a VIP Rewards Program for Small Business Email Marketing</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1327528134453" src="/Portals/123780/images/vip%20email%20marketing%20program-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="vip email marketing program resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><span><a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/affordable-email-marketing/" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">Small business email marketing</a> is a great tool to make your customers feel as important as they truly are to your business and bottom-line by providing rewards. Customers enjoy feeling as though they belong to an exclusive club or are members of a group that not everyone else is in.</span></p>
<p>This is the perfect opportunity for you to connect your business products and services with VIP club for your most loyal customers. Here are 4 simple steps to help you get the ball rolling.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Update Your Current Lists</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Start the New Year off RIGHT by going through your current lists and removing addresses that never open your list and add new customers. For many, this goes without saying, but I commonly come in contact with business owners who refuse to update their lists regularly. Ultimately, by refusing to remove emails and add new ones you set yourself up for failure when it comes to analytics and feedback, such as open and low click-through rates. In order for your campaigns to make a noticeable difference in your email marketing analytics data, your list must be up-to-date.</span> There's no way around it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Segmenting Time</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Now that you’ve finished project “out with the old, in with the new”, it is time to segment your lists based on a few factors.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30240/5-Savvy-Ways-to-Segment-Your-Marketing-Emails.aspx" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">Hubspot suggests</a> segmenting based on:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>geographic location,</li>
<li>industry role, </li>
<li>content interests,</li>
<li>behavior,</li>
<li>and brand advocates</li>
</ul>
<p>Your customers are diverse, so your lists should reflect that diversity. Lumping everyone together in generic categories will <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/103234/3-Common-Email-Marketing-Mistakes-That-Lead-to-Unsubscribes" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">lead to unsubscribes</a> and unopened emails. People are not interested in information that they do not find relevant to them. Although they may still use your products and services, once they have unsubscribed and/or blocked you, you have lost them forever.</p>
<p>As you are segmenting your list, be sure to keep track of the dates you perform updates. As more new customers subscribe to your email list in your physical location and your website, you can keep track of who is and isn’t in the database by looking at the input dates.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Create Targeted Content</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Now that you have your customers added (or deleted) and segmented properly, you can start to create TARGETED content based on the recipient’s wants and needs.</span></p>
<p>How do you know what your customer wants and needs are? Hopefully, you have conducted some type of research via online or in-store surveys or by some other means. If not, add this to your to-do list immediately. Too often marketers simply guess about their customers wants and needs without doing an inch of marketing research.  </p>
<p><span>Once you have research data in hand, take the time to review your list, use the knowledge you already have about your customers, and create content tailored to their interests and needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Invite Customers to become VIP Members</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Armed with a segmented list and targeted content, you are ready to get your VIP program rolled out to customers. This is where you can become creative and design the program to suite your business needs. Whatever you want the incentive for joining to be, whether you give a free service or gift after every 9 purchases or just offer reward discounts, make sure it has REAL VALUE. The last thing you want is for your most loyal customers to think you’re spamming them with a valueless offer.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/affordable-email-marketing/" title="Small business email marketing" target="_self">Small business email marketing</a> can do wonders for bringing in repeat customers to your business. Starting a VIP program to reward your most loyal customers is a great way to break out of your mundane email marketing routine. But this can be a tough order to fill for those of you who are still struggling to master email marketing for your business. Take a few minutes to read these our <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/?Tag=Email+Marketing" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">email marketing blogs</a> and let us know if you have any questions.</p>

      <title>Simplifying Google Places Search Results For Local Business Owners</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><a href="http://www.google.com/places/" target="_self"><img id="img-1327343836541" src="/Portals/123780/images/Google%20places%20search%20results-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Google places search results resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></a>Don't let the title of this blog fool you, there is nothing simple about <a href="/google-places-optimization/" title="Google Places search results" target="_self">Google Places search results</a> or getting your business to show up there for your city.  That being said I'm going to try to demystify <strong>Google places results</strong> so that you can better understand how you can utilize it to benefit your business.</p>
<p>If you own a business in the year 2012, you more than likely understand the importance of search engine visibility for the growth of your business.  National companies have two main sections to choose from when it comes to promoting themselves on Google's search engine, the organic search section and paid search section (<a href="/guide-to-search-advertising/" title="Google Adwords" target="_self">Google Adwords</a>).</p>
<p>The local business owner isn't so lucky. Enter "<strong>Google Places</strong>," The third section of Google's three headed local SERP monster.</p>
<p>Google's primary goal has always been to serve up the best results for searchers. Every change they make is to improve the searching experience for regular folk. Which is a big reason they have such a strong choke hold on the search engine market. In early 2010 Google began to recognize that over 20% of all searches had local intent, so they created Google Places, which was basically a revamp of its Google Maps Local Business Center.  The idea was to create a platform to support and encourage local search advertising.  In other words, Google's answer to the Internet Yellow Pages.  Below you will see an example of one of our clients Apex Garage Door Pro's <a href="http://www.google.com/places/" title="Google Places listing" target="_self">Google Places listing</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Google%20places%20listing-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Google places listing resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Google first unveiled Places to the public and gave us what we in the industry called the "10 pack," a list of 10 local businesses and their business information or NAP (Name Address Phone #). Local businesses who owned the first page of organic rankings at the time saw their position, traffic, and calls drop overnight as the "10 pack" replaced organic listings as the first section searchers would see when they performed a search for a local service.</p>
<p>As search engine marketers, we had to adapt and reverse engineer the new Google places algorithm or the value of our services would be in jeopardy.  So a bunch of marketers a lot more saavy then me (add self deprecation remark here) set out to conquer this new frontier and these are the ranking factors that were most common among high ranking places listings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Business must have a physical address in the city of search</li>
<li>Businesses must manualy verify their places listing</li>
<li>Businesses must use appropriate categories to describe what they do</li>
<li>High Volume of Citations with consistent Business info (online directories, review sites, data aggregators, etc.)</li>
<li>Businesses should complete profiles with photos, videos, etcs.</li>
<li>Crawlable address on website same as places page</li>
<li>Customer reviews on both places page and other online profiles</li>
</ol>
<p>As time has progressed so has the Google places algorithm, as well as the factors effecting top rankings. The "10 pack" has given way to the "7 pack" which we now see most often, along with a sprinkle of "3 packs" and "1 packs."</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Google%20Places%207%20pack-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Google Places 7 pack resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Now remember when we said that Google's primary goal was to provide the best search experience, well flash forward several months, and after tons of Google Places spam and working with a Google Place’s algorithm that doesn’t really work… the fellas at Google decided to revert back to an algorithm that is proven to work pretty darn well, and rolled out "Blended results" a hybrid model combining aspects of both the 7 pack and organic results.  Below you will see an example of "Blended" results with another one of our clients "King's Carpet Cleaning" in the A position.  Note the subtle difference in "7 pack" and "blended" as the blended bring in meta descriptions in addition to NAP info.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Google%20Places%20Blended%20Results-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Google Places Blended Results resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Ranking factors for "Blended" Google Places results lies more in good ole' fashion SEO techniques rather than the "7 pack" factors (We believe the ratio is about 80% SEO to 20% 7 pack type factors).  To be even more specific, to rank well in blended results you should build high quality backlinks with your target keyword as "anchor text" to your websites homepage.</p>
<p>So this is the hand local marketers and local business owners are currently dealt. I don't know what the future holds, but one thing is certain Google places will evolve and we will have to adapt in order to market our businesses successfully.  Are you up for it?</p>
<p>We'd love to answer any questions you might have about Google places, so please feel free to leave your questions or praise:) in the comment section and we'll be sure to answer them.  In the mean time click on the button below to watch a webinar we did on optimizing your Google Places listing.</p>

      <title>5 Ways to Grow Targeted Twitter Followers Using Tweet Spinner</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1327353861336" src="/Portals/123780/images/TweetSpinner-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="TweetSpinner resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Audience targeting on Twitter is both time-consuming and problematic to say the least. If you find yourself spending countless hours on Twitter searching tirelessly for people who would be interested in your product, you should look into using <a href="http://tweetspinner.com" rel="nofollow" title="Tweet Spinner" target="_blank">Tweet Spinner</a>.</p>
<p>Tweet Spinner is designed to help businesses grow their following on Twitter by micro-targeting user profiles. While its overall visual image leaves much to be desired, Tweet Spinner makes up for its lackluster appearance with a suprisingly robust set of features that help you zero in on the users/customers you want to find and hide the rest.</p>
<p>Even though, Tweet Spinner has been around for a few years, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/searchdogmarket">SearchDog Marketing</a> just recently decided to test it out. We will report back in a few months with an official review, but for now, we will explain our attraction to this program. </p>
<h2><span style="color: #990000;"><b>5 Features We Like About Tweet Spinner</b></span></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #808080;"><b>1.   Build Smart Tweets Using Tweetscript </b></span></h2>
<h2><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">You can also use tweetscript to schedule rules-based updates called Smart Tweets. You can schedule these Smart Tweets to release over time similar to Hootsuite; however, Tweet Spinner developers place a heavy emphasis on not using this program as a spam tool. Check out their <a href="http://rulesoftheroad" title="Rules of the Road tips" target="_blank">Rules of the Road tips</a> for a more in-depth explanation, so you don't run the risk of having your account suspended. </span></h2>
<p>The rules seem to be simple enough. What is especially neat about Smart Tweets is that you can set contingency triggers that release specific tweets based on construct complex IF/THEN/ELSE and EITHER/OR situations. </p>

<p><b>Examples...</b></p>
<p><em>Thanks for following me [{fullname}]! You have [{followers_count}] followers after your [{created}] days you've been on Twitter. *Source: www.tweetspinner.com</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://tweetspinner.com/tscript" target="_blank"><img id="img-1327352804401" src="/Portals/123780/images/HowtouseTweetscript-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="HowtouseTweetscript resized 600"></a><br></em></p>
<h2><span style="color: #808080;"><b>2.      Follower Manager</b></span></h2>
<p><img id="img-1327353355834" src="/Portals/123780/images/followers-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Follower Manager" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Finding interesting people to follow on Twitter is challenging considering the prevalence of spammers and low-quality profiles out there. Nevertheless, interesting people are out there waiting to be found and followed. Tweet Spinner makes this easier with the Follower Manager, which uses sophisticated filters to find potential people to follow. Yes, Twitter has a “Who to Folllow” feature embedded in its interface. After you’ve spent about 3 minutes following those suggested people, you will soon find yourself in need of more people to follow. Follower Manager also removes spam, inactive and problematic profiles from your follower list. </p>
<h2><span style="color: #808080;"><b>3.      Integrating SEO Keyword Following</b></span></h2>
<p>Take the list of keywords you are using to help your website rank higher in search engines and add them to the Keyword Following box on Tweet Spinner. You can filter users who tweet those keywords.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #808080;"><b>4.      Mimic Following</b></span></h2>
<p>Automatically following the friends (mutual followers) and followers of certain users is made easy with the Mimic Following filter. Why would you want to do this, you ask? Because it is a good idea to follow the friends of users you want to reach. People are more inclined to follow you back if they see some of their friends and followers already following you (confusing, I know). </p>
<h2><span style="color: #808080;"><b>5.      Profile Rotator</b></span></h2>
<p>The Profile Rotator feature allows you to switch between different bios and profile images. At first glance, this feature may seem frivolous, but I beg to differ.</p>
<p><img id="img-1327344806186" src="/Portals/123780/images/Profile%20Rotator1-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Profile Rotator resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>I notice when people update their Twitter bio or their profile image. I especially notice when it’s done routinely. However, I don’t think people with few followers and follow-backs should over use this feature. You want people to be able to consistently recognize your brand. It'll be hard to do that if your profile is branded differently every week. Nevertheless, it is totally acceptable to change your background design and profile image for certain promotions.  </p>
<p>If you would like to try a more systematic approach to growing your Twitter following, you should take a look at Tweet Spinner. It may not be the right tool for you, but it has been around for a while, so it's working for someone.</p>

      <title>5 Ways for Businesses to Get Started on Pinterest</title>

	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Pinterest_Logo-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Pinterest Logo resized 600"></p>
<p>The latest social media trend to emerge on the scene, Pinterest, already has <a href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2011/12/22/pinterest-sees-site-visits-increase-by-4000-in-just-6-months/" target="_blank">millions of active users</a>. </p>
<p>The obvious dominant demographic using <a href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> is women. These recipe collecting, scrapbooking, fashion forward woman have lots to say and share. Slowly but surely, guys are growing in numbers, but after looking through a few boards it's crystal clear who the primary users are. Whether male or female, Pinterest users are collecting images to find inspiration to create, style, build, etc. This self-proclaimed "virtual pinboard" has opened the door for businesses to drive purchase decisions organically by capitalizing on consumer and brand loyalty that already exists to generate more. All business owners need to do is join the party and make it easier for consumers to pin their content.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #808080;"><b>5 Ways for Businesses to Get Started on Pinterest:</b></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;">1.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Request an Invitation, Wait and Research</span></h3>
<p>It'll take a few days for Pinterest to get back with you, so take a minute right now to request an invitation. This doesn't mean make a sticky note with "Join Pinterest" on it and get back to this later. You can still search pins and boards, so start researching pins  related to your business products, services, locations and keywords to see what is already out there. Make note of the pins with the most likes and repins. Follow the popular users and wait for an opening to interact with them.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;">2.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Build Good Will</span></h3>
<p>Spend some time pinning and repining content, as well as commenting and liking others pins and boards. Do not expect people to automatically flock to your content unless you are a major corporation with a strong consumer base already. It will take some interacting and initiation on your part to get the ball rolling, so work the room. Scope out the heavy hitters (users with lots of repins and likes) and make nice. </p>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Use Long-Tail and Descriptive Keywords </b></span>
<p><b></b>I love Ray Bans. In fact, that was my first search on Pinterest. What came up in the search results shocked me a little bit. I actually searched "Ray Bans" and everything from Ray Charles and Ray Lewis to Ray of Honey Cable Stitch and Parmesan-Crusted Chicken, Rachael Ray came up. I was shocked to not find myself overwhelmed by this very diverse array of options from such a limited keyword search. The first few results were only of Ray Bans and got more random as the list grew. Use long-tail keywords and more descriptive to make sure you show up in the top results.   </p>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b>4.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Add Browser Buttons to Encourage Pins and Sharing </b></span>
<p>Adding "Pin It" buttons to your Internet browser is a great way to help remind yourself to pin cool things you find online. Remember what we said in the <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/118575/Pinterest-The-New-Social-Media-Site-Brands-Must-Join" target="_blank">first blog about Pinterest</a>, you should not only create boards and pins about things related to your business. </p>
<p><img id="img-1327006416947" src="/Portals/123780/images/Pin%20It%20Button%20for%20Websites-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Pin It Button for Websites resized 600"></p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;">5.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Drive Traffic from Other Social Media Sites</span></h3>
<p>You can login from Facebook or Twitter, which will make it easier to drive friends and followers to your Pinterest page. But you should also use these and other sites like Tumblr and  your company blog to drive traffic to your pin boards. From now on, when you have a picture of a product to share, you should always make it shareable on Pinterest.  </p>
<p>These are just a few of the ways businesses can lay some solid ground work for their Pinterest account. As with any other social media venture, you should reserve time for monitoring and environmental scanning. Do not jump into engagement haphazardly and except success. If you're interested in more tips and best practices for social media marketing in general, we've got you covered there too. </p>

      <title>Pinterest: The New Social Media Site Brands Must Join</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1326810352589" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-01-17%20at%209.10.26%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Pinterest for business" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>A cool, new photo sharing/social media site has emerged on the scene and is starting to generate some SEO buzz. Pinterest is growing in popularity among users, causing some marketers to predict it will soon give Flickr a run for its money. To make a long story short, Pinterest is a social bookmarking tool that allows users to “pin” content (images or videos) into themed collections called Boards (we’ll get back to this later).</p>
<p>Marketers and <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="SEO consultants" target="_self">SEO consultants</a> should make immediate plans to request a membership with Pinterest, due to both its growing popularity and lack of a “nofollow” link attribute tied to the site. Nofollow means that backlinks from a site won’t count for search ranking purposes, but thankfully Pinterest doesn’t adhere to this attribute…at least for now. Marketers have a clear window of opportunity to capitalize on here.</p>
<p>The lack of advertising opportunities force users to cultivate content creatively to really get mileage out of this site. The general rule of etiquette here is to not get caught up in shameless self-promotion. Leave that for Facebook and Twitter. Don’t fret, there are steps you can take to engage consumers without breaking the community rules.<b> </b></p>
<p>Before you jump on the Pinterest bandwagon, lets discuss what the site involves and where the benefit lies for business owners and marketers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><b>What’s the Big Deal?</b></span></p>
<p>The big deal about Pinterest is that it has combined two of the most compelling aspects of social media: striking and likeable visual content and a share-happy community. Think about everything we are told about sharing and <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/109963/Edgerank-Score-What-is-it-and-How-Does-It-Effect-My-Facebook-Page" title="engagement on Facebook" target="_self">engagement on Facebook</a> – you should share VISUAL content because people love it. Pinterest has applied that same philosophy to their entire site and it WORKS. </p>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b>What’s a Pin?</b></span>
<p>Pinterest users share images or video uploaded from a user’s computer or from a website. The images or videos they share are called Pins.</p>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b>What are Boards?</b></span>
<p>Pins live on Boards, which are organized by topic. Pinterest will give you a few boards to start out with, but you can modify the name or delete them altogether. Warning to business owners and marketers: do not create pins ONLY related to your business and business name. You have the ability to create numerous boards, so mix it up. Try to organize boards with pins that will be of interest to your target demographic. </p>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b>Other Social Media Rules Still Apply.</b></span>
<p>Similar to Twitter, Pinterest allows you to follow your friends and customers and they have the option of not following you back. You don’t have to follow all of their boards, only those you select.</p>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b>Repins = Retweets</b></span>
<p>Repins are the equalivanet of retweets in the Twitter world. When you “repin” content from someone else’s boards, you add it to your own boards.</p>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b>Likes = Likes</b></span>
<p>As we said before, many of the same social media rules transfer to Pinterest. Facebook’s “Like” concept is another thing that Pinterest adopted. When you like a pin, it is then added to your profile as a “like” and not to your boards.</p>
<span style="color: #990000;"><b>Where Do I Sign-Up?</b></span>
<p><img id="img-1326967625388" src="/Portals/123780/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-01-17%20at%209.11.29%20AM-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Join Pinterest" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Currently, the only way to <a href="http://pinterest.com/" title="sign-up for membership" target="_self">sign-up for membership</a> is to request an invitation from the folks behind Pinterest. It is relatively simple. Just go to their website and follow the instructions.<b></b></p>

<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><b>2 Undeniable Benefits for Businesses and Marketers</b></span></h3>
<p>Pinterest is a great way to reach out to customers and show another layer of your brands interests and personality. Additionally, there is SEO value that can attract consumers to your business site in an untraditional way.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #999999;">1.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Brand Awareness</span></h3>
<p>If customers love your products and they can be visually represented, there is a great chance they will pin it. More pins mean more awareness about your brand, but the awareness is more authentic than advertising or social media marketing. Customers are not clicking on a paid ad or going directly to your site to find your products. Instead they unexpectedly stumble upon them on a cool site. This type of natural, organic, almost passive engagement can go a long way with consumers. </p>
<b><span style="color: #999999;">2.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Link Building</span><br></b><ol></ol>
<p>The great thing about pinning and getting repinned is that whenever someone does so, it creates a link to your website. Pinterest backlinks are valuable, and are a definite way to <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="increase your SEO rankings" target="_self">increase your SEO rankings</a> and get your content seen by more people. There is no limit to the number of times someone can repin your content, so imagine what 100 or more repins would mean for your SEO ranking over time. </p>

      <title>5 Content Strategy Tips for Email Marketers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><a href="/affordable-email-marketing/" title="Email marketing" target="_self">Email marketing</a> is still by far the most cost effective way and fastest to reach out to customers except social media.  Almost anyone can call themselves an email marketer now that companies like <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com" title="Mail Chimp" target="_blank">Mail Chimp</a> and <a href="http://www.constantcontact.com" title="Constant Contact" target="_self">Constant Contact</a> have made it so easy and affordable to create email campaigns. </p>
<p>There is only one thing stopping these amateurs and DIY folks from harnessing the full potential of email marketing and that is a poor content strategy. What the pros know that you do not know is how to create compelling content that entices customers to ACT. So, here are 5 content strategies that can help your email campaigns reach more customers every time.</p>
<ol style="display: inline !important;">
<li style="display: inline !important;">
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><b><b>1.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The Inverted Pyramid</b></b></span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An age-old rule of thumb for journalists and public relations practitioners is something called The Inverted Pyramid, which calls for the most important information to be placed at the top of a story and the least important at the bottom. This is the traditional way press releases are structured, because journalists cut stories down from the bottom. When your customers open your email, it will take them about 5 seconds to decide if they will continue reading. The first few sentences of your email are crucial to retaining your readers attention, so put your most important information here.</p>
<img id="img-1326396112761" src="/Portals/123780/images/invertedpyramid-resized-600.gif" border="0" alt="invertedpyramid resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><h4><span style="color: #999999;"><b>Email Marketing Takeaway:</b> </span></h4>
<p>Make sure your offer is plainly stated in the first 2 sentences of your email. Readers should know the purpose of your email, the offer, why they should want it, and how they can get it.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><b><b>2.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Stay Focused On A Single Offer Per Email</b></b></span></h3>
<p>Having lots of options to choose from is a great thing in every arena except <span style="color: #990000;"><a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/63248/7-Benefits-of-Small-Business-Email-Marketing" title="email marketing" target="_self"><span style="color: #990000;">email marketing</span></a></span>. Customers can go to Wal-Mart when they want variety, but should not be expected to shop around in an email. This is why so many email templates are themed for certain event types, holidays and even sales pitches. Unless you are sending a comprehensive email newsletter, focus the content of your email around a single offer alone. With less choices to choose from, customers will be more likely to choose SOMETHING. </p>
<h4><span style="color: #888888;"><b>Email Marketing Takeaway: </b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><b></b></span>From the body copy to the sidebar, make sure your email has only one offer when customers open it. In the event that your email list is incredibly diverse with a number of different demographic groups represented, you should consider segmenting your list out. This way, you can send different offers to different segments and have a better chance of connecting with them. </p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><b>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Mobile Device Optimization &amp; Text-Only Version Clean-Up</b></span></h3>
<p>Everyone has a smartphone these days, even small children. So, it is a logical guess that most people with email accounts check them on their smartphones. Did you think to optimize your email to be viewed on mobile devices like iPhones and iPads? No? </p>
<p><img id="img-1326396707462" src="/Portals/123780/images/Study-Shows-31-Percent-of-US-Mobile-Users-Check-Email-4--Times-Daily-Are-Your-Campaigns-Optimized-resized-600.gif" border="0" alt="Mobile Email Users" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h4><span style="color: #888888;"><b>Email Marketing Takeaway:</b> </span></h4>
<p>Before you send your next email, see what it looks like on a <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/116909/Mobile-Sites-Vs-Mobile-Apps-Which-Is-Best-For-Your-Business" title="mobile device" target="_self">mobile device</a>. Adjust the design and photos as necessary. Call customer service to get some pointers on how to better optimize your email to be viewed on a mobile device. Clean up the text-only version, as well. Email clients sometimes have glitches that do not display HTML content, causing the email to show as the text-only version. Links are not useful in text-only versions and usually break the flow of the text. A few minutes spent adjusting your email for mobile devices and cleaning up the text-only version may seem like a complete waste of time, but it is the little things that mean the most sometimes.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><b>4.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Socialize Your Emails</b></span></h3>
<p>Integrating social media into your email campaign is something every marketer and business owner should be doing. Companies like MailChimp and Constant Contact have simplified the process of inserting Facebook Like and Tweet buttons. You can also instantly publish your email on Twitter and Facebook when you send it to your list, which is a great timesaver. Not to mention, Constant Contact just rolled out a <span style="color: #990000;"><a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/social-media-for-small-business/index.jsp" title="social media marketing component" target="_self"><span style="color: #990000;">social media marketing component</span></a></span> of their service that allows subscribers to create Facebook landing pages. There is no question that this is a great benefit for business owners and marketers who do not have landing pages. The only downside is the templates you have to choose from because they leave much to be desired design-wise. </p>
<p><img id="img-1326396769162" src="/Portals/123780/images/mobile%20social%20network%20users-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="describe the image" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h4><span style="color: #888888;"><b>Email Marketing Takeaway: </b></span></h4>
<p><b></b>If you are not integrating social media into your email marketing, you are single-handedly destroying the only means (besides forwarding emails) your customers have to share the email with their friends. With the click of a button, you can give your customers the power create some genuine buzz about your offer. Don’t just wait for them to share it, actually TELL them to do so in your content! You’ll be amazed at how many people are eager to share a discount or cool blog with others who might find it interesting. So, do yourself a favor and get social!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><b>5.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Include Likeable &amp; Valuable Content</b></span></h3>
<p>If your email is boring, no one will share, like or tweet it. If your offer holds little to no value for the customer, no one will act or share it with their circle. If your emails continue to be boring and valueless, people will begin to unsubscribe from your list. These are facts you cannot avoid or deny. If you wondered why only two people have taken advantage of your $1 off Facebook check-in offer, it isn’t because they don’t know the real value of a dollar. That dollar isn’t valuable enough for them to remember. </p>
<h4><span style="color: #888888;"><b>Email Marketing Takeaway:</b> </span></h4>
<p>If you want people to like or take advantage of your offers, make it worth their wild to do so. Make the discount something worth talking about, something worth tweeting about. When it comes to marketing, email or not, you get what you put in. Anything that lacks value will not receive a good reception.</p>

      <title>Mobile Sites Vs. Mobile Apps: Which Is Best For Your Business?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Remember that wonderful moment when your business website went live for the first time? Or a customer made the first purchase from your online store? Now that you have taken that glorious stroll down memory lane, it is time to face the fact that your standard website is no longer enough to reach today’s mobile consumer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><a href="http://www.vibes.com/ebooks/eMarketer_Mobile_Advertising_and_Marketing-Moving_to_the_Mainstream.pdf"><span style="color: #990000;">eMarketer projects</span></a></span> that the number of U.S. smartphone users will increase from 90.1 million in 2011 to 148.6 million in 2015, represent 46% of the total U.S. population. But you did not need eMarketer to tell you that to know more people are getting smartphones these days. You see the proof everyday on the train, in restaurants, and on the way to work. What you see is the eyes of people glued to cell phones and iPads. Their thumbs are scrolling furiously as they search for information about places to eat, shop, rest, stay, and play. They are standing in lines overnight for the latest version of Apple’s iPad, because trend now is to access information on the go, not at a bulky desktop or laptop computer. If your business does not have a website optimized for mobile devices, you can rest assured that you are missing out on conversions.</p>
<p>Your current and potential customers are increasingly avoiding traditional marketing channels to escape the noise. This means your advertising dollars may or may not be bringing the return you hope for. But money spent on developing your business site is ALWAYS money well spent. Before you start wondering about prices, let’s talk more about what type of mobile web presence would work best for your business – a mobile site or mobile application. First and foremost, you should know what the difference between the two options.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Know the Difference </b></span></p>
<p>Many people make the mistake of thinking mobile sites and applications are one in the same. Although they can have similarities, they are actually very different platforms.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Mobile Sites</b></span> deliver a fast, efficient and browser-based experience for users. The content usually appears in a list form although more sophisticated designs are possible. Mobile sites are also easy for consumers to access from any device because the features adjust to the type of device it’s displayed on. Sites also automatically recognize that a mobile device is trying to access it and displays the optimized site instead of the standard version. Smart technology. </p>
<p>Adversely, <span style="color: #990000;"><b>Mobile Applications </b></span>are not readily available to the public, because they are trapped inside an app store. Consumers have to log into the app store and download the app to access the information inside. Apps are growing at a slower pace than websites, as well. Apps also tend to cost more to develop than mobile sites and cost more money to maintenance. Imagine that apps are BMW’s and mobile sites are Honda’s. Honda is dependable, ranges from economy to semi-luxurious, and costs less to maintain and repair. But that BMW, let’s just say your oil changes are around $100.00.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact about apps is that you have to develop different apps for different devices, unlike mobile sites, which are universally accessible. Get where we are going with this blog?</p>
<p>If you have yet to read enough to make an informed decision for your business, take a few seconds to think about the apps you downloaded in the past year. Think about how frequently you accessed those apps as opposed to going to your web browser. Think about glitches, load times, and the frustration you felt. Chances are, your customers customers share your feelings. However, marketing theoris should not be made based on feelings along. It is a better practice to base theories off research, so here is what we found.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Why Mobile Sites Matter</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/1/comScore_Reports_November_2010_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share"><span style="color: #990000;">Comscore’s November 2010 report</span></a></span> on mobile content usage shows only a small difference between browser usage compared to downloaded apps. Comscore’s findings only cover a span of three months, so it is unknown how results from a more longitudinal look like.</p>
<p><span style="color: #990000;"><a href="http://www.howtogomo.com/en/#reasons-mobile-matters"><span style="color: #990000;">HowtoGoMo.com</span></a></span> gave us more insight into customer behavior and expectations when it comes to mobile sites.</p>

<p>There's more...</p>

<p>We can talk about the benefits of mobile sites for days, but what is important for you to know is that sites are a good starting point for any business looking to optimize the customer mobile web experience. If you want to graduate to a robust mobile application later on, fine. Anything done well and for the right audience will be successful, but we cannot promise you people will actually take the time to download and reload it each time. You have to ask yourself, can you do the mobile app WELL and is it RIGHT for your customer base, products and services? Or is a less costly, faster loading, easily accessible mobile site a better fit? If you have questions or comments, we would love to help you decide which is better for your business. </p>

      <title>How Mobile-Friendly Sites Help Businesses Connect With Customers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>After reading yesterday’s blog from HubSpot <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30425/7-best-practices-for-a-successful-mobile-check-in-campaign?source=BlogTwitter_%5B7%20Best%20Practices%20for%5D">on successful mobile check-in campaigns</a>, we started thinking about businesses and mobile marketing. There is no doubt that businesses should take advantage of the opportunities “check-in” campaigns have generated in recent years.</p>
<p>This got us thinking about the bigger picture. Before businesses step into the realm of social media marketing, which will bring more attention to them online, they should assess their web presence. More specifically, businesses should assess their mobile web presence to see if their site is up to par for the amount of potential customers a mobile check-in campaign will bring.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Why Mobile Sites Matter</b></span></h2>
<p>If you own a mobile device of any kind, chances are you used it to get online. In fact, millions of people use mobile devices, from cell phones to tables, to shop online, check up on the latest news, update social media, play online games and much more. Naturally, more business owners and marketers are choosing to capitalize on this technology and social shift by designing mobile-friendly sites to connect with customers.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Does Your Business Have a Mobile Friendly Site?</b> </span></h2>
<p>If the thought of a mobile website never crossed your mind, back away from the computer screen, whip out your tablet or cell phone, pull up your website and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/searchdogmarketing">tell us if you like what you see</a>. </p>
<p>If the answer is no, you can rest assured that your customers or clients probably share your sentiments. And if you think no one visits your website from a mobile device, think again. Research shows that mobile searches grew by 4X since 2010 and that by 2013 more people will use their mobile phones than PCs to get online.</p>
<p>Businesses can either embrace the trend or be left behind.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #990000;"><b>What Are Mobile-Friendly Sites?</b><b> </b></span></h2>
<p>Just because your website is optimized for a desktop and laptop doesn’t mean it looks so hot on a mobile device. Whether it's for a cell phone or iPad, mobile sites are designed for a screen size specific to the type of device it will be seen on. Remember to design your mobile site with the consumer in mind. A mobile-friendly site has the power to drive conversions.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #990000;"><b>How To Build Your Site</b><b> </b></span></h2>

      <title>4 Big Social Media Moments of 2011</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<br>The year 2011 saw many milestones in the world of social media. While some were more positive than others, one thing is for sure - the impact and involvement of social media is changing the way society interacts. In this blog, we’ve shared what we consider to be 4 Big Social Media Moments (out of countless others) that hold importance for internet marketers and business owners. Feel free to share your comments on these and other big social media moments of 2011.   <br><b></b><br><h2><span style="color: #800000;"><b>1.    </b> <b><a href="blog/bid/107953/3-Tips-To-Help-Businesses-Engage-Their-Customers-on-Google"><span style="color: #800000;">Google Launches Google+ Pages</span></a> </b></span></h2>
<p><img id="img-1325532929397" src="/Portals/123780/images/Google--Logo-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Google launches google+" width="192" height="185" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
Google FINALLY joined the social media party, but definitely on their own terms. Google+ launched in 2011 and since then everyone has been in a rush to join and dominate this new network. It remains to be seen whether this social network will truly be useful to marketers, but it’s definitely a nice tool to add to the arsenal and connect with friends.<ol></ol>

<span style="color: #800000;"><b>2.    </b></span><b><span style="color: #800000;"><a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/111646/Saudi-Prince-Invests-300-Million-In-Twitter-After-Site-Revamp" title="Twitter Gets $300 Million Investment From Saudi Prince" target="_self"><span style="color: #800000;">Twitter Gets $300 Million Investment From Saudi Prince</span></a></span> <br></b>

Twitter got a new group of well-endowed investors this month. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and his investment company, Kingdom Holding Company announced plans to invest millions into the micro-blogging site. Happy New Year Twitter!<ol></ol>
<h2><span style="color: #800000;"><b>3.    </b><b>Fox News Twitter Hack </b></span></h2>
After several alarming and unusual tweets were sent from the Fox News Twitter account, it became apparent that they were the victims of a malicious hack job. The tweets were false and claimed that President Obama was assassinated when he was actually spending time with his family.<img id="img-1325532054588" src="/Portals/123780/images/FOX-NEWS-TWITTER-HACKED-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="2011 social media moments" width="357" height="598" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><ol></ol>Fox News <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/07/04/foxnewspolitics-twitter-feed-hacked/">released a statement</a> confirming as much. Twitter accounts get hacked every other day, so that wasn’t a huge shock. It’s what the tweets said that blew us away. Although Fox promised to launch a full-scale investigation into how the hack took place, we all know that there is no escaping the wrath of hackers. <br><br><h2><span style="color: #800000;"><b>4.    </b><b>#Weinergate Yfrog Photo Fiasco</b></span></h2>
U.S. Anthony Weiner was the center of much <a href="http://biggovernment.com/publius/2011/05/28/weinergate-congressman-claims-facebook-hacked-as-lewd-photo-hits-twitter/">controversy</a> following allegations of sending a photo from his official Twitter account of a man in underwear with an apparent erection. The picture was tied back to his Twitter account via Yfrog. In very little time, the photo was re-tweeted by way more people than we’re sure Weiner ever wanted.<ol></ol>It was a less than tasteful photo to say the least and a tough break for Weiner, who was well on his way to becoming the next mayor of New York City. After lying about the situation, he finally admitted to sending the photo of himself and having several relationships with women. He then later resigned. Another classic case of smart phones and dumb people.<br><br>Wonder what's in store for social media in 2012?  <br><br><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-14594eb9-955c-468b-8f04-dd545ea8441e" class="hs-cta-wrapper" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;  width: 286px;  height: 67px; display: block;  border-width: 0px;">  <span class="hs-cta-node hs-cta-14594eb9-955c-468b-8f04-dd545ea8441e" id="hs-cta-14594eb9-955c-468b-8f04-dd545ea8441e"> <a href="http://facebook.com/searchdogmarketing" data-mce-href="http://facebook.com/searchdogmarketing"><img id="hs-cta-img-14594eb9-955c-468b-8f04-dd545ea8441e" src="//d1n2i0nchws850.cloudfront.net/portals/123780/40766fb5-6943-449a-a80f-64e3ac4f44d5-1323713627242/like-our-facebook-page.png?v=1323713627.52" alt="quotlikequot-our-facebook-page" class="hs-cta-img" style="border-width:0px" mce_noresize="1" data-mce-src="//d1n2i0nchws850.cloudfront.net/portals/123780/40766fb5-6943-449a-a80f-64e3ac4f44d5-1323713627242/like-our-facebook-page.png?v=1323713627.52" data-mce-style="border-width: 0px;"></a> </span><script type="text/javascript"> (function(){   var hsjs = document.createElement("script");      hsjs.type = "text/javascript";      hsjs.async = true;      hsjs.src = "//cta-service.cms.hubspot.com/cta-service/loader.js?placement_guid=14594eb9-955c-468b-8f04-dd545ea8441e";   (document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(hsjs);   setTimeout(function() {document.getElementById("hs-cta-14594eb9-955c-468b-8f04-dd545ea8441e").style.visibility="hidden"}, 1);   setTimeout(function() {document.getElementById("hs-cta-14594eb9-955c-468b-8f04-dd545ea8441e").style.visibility="visible"}, 2000); })(); </script></span> <br><br><br><br><a href="https://plus.google.com/110463090892012135729?rel=author">Google+</a>

      <title>7 New Years Resolutions for Your 2012 Social Media Strategy</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><span style="color: #c10000;"><img id="img-1325101949634" src="/Portals/123780/images/2012%20Social%20media%20marketing%20strategy-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="2012 Social media marketing strategy resized 600" width="278" height="278" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"></span>Around this time every year, people find themselves making outlandish declarations about what they will and won’t do for the New Year. Popular resolutions often involve quitting smoking, losing weight, getting over past relationships, or buying a new car. Pretty much whatever your heart desires is up for grabs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of those resolutions do not survive past Martin Luther King Jr. Day, SO we at SearchDog Marketing have devised a 7 easy to attain New Years resolutions to share. What makes them so attainable is that they are not necessarily for your personal growth, but hold definite promise for the growth and prosperity of your <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing" title="social media" target="_self">social media</a> presence.</p>
<p><span style="color: #c10000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1.   Limit Sales Pitches</b></span> – In 2012, force yourself to stop bombarding people with marketing messages. Only 20% of your social media posts should be marketing messages. If you’re confused by percentages, here’s a good rule of thumb: 1 marketing message for every 7 or 8 posts of helping and informing your audience. People will follow and fan you because they are genuinely interested in what you have to say and find it valuable.</p>
<p><br><span style="color: #c10000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2.   Leverage Your Physical Presence</b></span> – This is the year that the customers who come into your business become the people you engage on social media. You have spent too much time and effort searching for them online that you forgot to capture them where they spend the most time – in your business. If your business has a physical location where transactions take place, you have the perfect opportunity to connect with your audience. Get your Facebook and Twitter links on your receipts immediately. Design and post some signage explaining the benefits of being your fan or follower. And leave it there. Forget about it. Your customers will see it and friend you on their own.</p>
<p><span style="color: #c10000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3.   Be Consistent with your content creation </b></span>– You took the time to <a href="blog/bid/87789/Business-Blogging-101-Blogging-Tips-For-Newbies">start a business blog</a>, but unfortunately it gets very little traffic. The design is sleek, the photos are great, the text was handcrafted by a highly trained wordsmith, but alas, your customers still don’t visit. So, you start to question the success of your marketing plan. If you have a blog, people should magically want to read it, right? Wrong. Well, do I give up?  Absolutely not, content marketing takes time.  Stick with it and create extraordinary content that creates value for your potential customers. Like they say in Field of Dreams, "If you build it, they will come."</p>
<p><br><span style="color: #c10000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4.</b><b>    </b></span><b><span style="color: #c10000;">Play Nice, Don’t Push</span> – </b>It’s ok to ask people to follow you and request comments on your posts. What’s not okay is electronic bullying and harassment. You want people to be drawn to your page by the witty commentary and diversity of content. Don’t push them away by demanding participation at every turn or being the creeper who comments on every random post they make. Be resolved to be more social and less pushy in 2012.</p>
<p><span style="color: #c10000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>5.</b><b>    </b></span><b><span style="color: #c10000;">Diversify Your Content</span> – </b>People like variety in life. That’s why Starbucks has a mile-long menu with everything from coffee and breakfast food to turkey sandwiches and sweet tea. The same goes for social media. By mixing up your content, you can make your business appear as if it has many layers. So, ask questions post interesting quotes, photos and videos. This will also boost your <a href="blog/bid/109963/Edgerank-Score-What-is-it-and-How-Does-It-Effect-My-Facebook-Page">Edgerank Score on Facebook,</a> so your content floats to the top of your fans newsfeed. Not all of your content has to be originally produced. If you see something that’s getting a lot of hits, send it to your fans and followers so they can enjoy it too. It makes you look cool and up-to-date. Moreover, it makes you not appear like a robot that is focused solely on making sales instead of meaningful interactions. Those interactions are fueled by a diversity of content. Claim it in 2012.<br><span style="color: #c10000;"><b></b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c10000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>6.</b><b>    </b></span><b><span style="color: #c10000;">Keep Rewarding Your Fans &amp; Followers</span> – </b>Offering rewards to your customers is something they will always appreciate. Try to be more giving in the New Year. Whether you’re giving away free samples at your physical location or offering discounts on services or goods on your Facebook page – give SOMETHING to SOMEONE. The reward you get is priceless, because you’ll have made a lasting impression on your fans orfollowers as being a ‘giver.’ They will remember your kindness and return for more.</p>
<p><span style="color: #c10000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>7.</b><b>    </b></span><b><span style="color: #c10000;">Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance</span> – </b>I learned this mantra from my 12<sup>th<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span></sup>grade English teacher Mr. Kilpatrick. Even though that was many moons ago, the 5 P’s still hold true today and in 2012. If social media will truly generate a return for your business and value for your fans and followers, you must PLAN. Nothing amazing is accomplished last minute or as an afterthought. So take some time RIGHT NOW to set some goals for your 2012 social media strategy. List out strategies for accomplishing those goals and then tactics for carrying out your strategies.</p>

      <title>5 Ways to Gauge Your SEO Effectiveness</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1324938307334" src="/Portals/123780/images/gauge%20seo%20effectiveness-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="gauge seo effectiveness" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">Keeping track of where you stand for purposes of evaluating the effectiveness of your <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="search engine optimization" target="_self">search engine optimization</a> (SEO) efforts is a key to making them work well for you. But what is the best way to do that? Here are several tips for gauging how well your SEO is working.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Page Rank</strong></span></h3>
<p>Just do a search for your keywords and see where your web site falls. If it’s in the top five ranks on the first page, as a result of a search around the most important key words, you’ve got good visibility and traffic is likely to come. If not, you might want to look at improving the relevance of the site’s content, form, meta-data, etc. to those keywords.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Site Visits Per Month</strong></span></h3>
<p>The whole idea behind <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="SEO" target="_self">SEO</a> is to drive more people to visit the web site, so this is really the acid test. If you have a high number of monthly site visits, that’s an initial indicator that your SEO strategy is working. However, it’s not the final indicator, not the be-all and end-all.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Page Views</strong></span></h3>
<p>No, this is not the same measure as site visits. It’s a measure of the number of times people view pages incorporated into your web site. The problem is that someone may see your page show up on a search, click the link thinking it might be what they’re looking for, quickly determine that it’s not, and go back. If that happens, you haven’t driven any business your way. This is a sign that you haven’t done a good job of relating keywords to content.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Time On Site</strong></span></h3>
<p>This has to do not only with the effectiveness of SEO but also with the design of the site itself. A site that is well designed, easy to navigate, and easy on the eyes will find people spending more time on the average browsing it. It relates to SEO as well, for the same reason that page views does: a person who clicks a link by mistake isn’t going to spend a lot of time on the site, most likely, while someone who finds content appropriate to what he’s searching for will.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #990000;"><strong>Links From Outside</strong></span></h3>
<p>Perhaps the real acid test is how many links are created from outside web pages inbound to yours. Inbound links are an important way to drive traffic your direction, and they also increase the site’s ranking in searches. When people are linking your site on their Facebook pages, referencing and linking your site in their blogs, and so on, then you know you are receiving not only high volumes of traffic but high quality traffic as well.</p>

      <title>4 Ways to Spread Holiday Deals With Email Marketing and Social Media</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p class="x_MsoNormal"><img id="img-1325765405357" src="/Portals/123780/images/email%20marketing%20and%20social%20media-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="email marketing and social media" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">This is the busiest time of year for shoppers and you like every other business owner is interested in ways to break your messages through all the noise and clutter. This can be a very difficult goal to attain, especially when it comes to competing against big retailers.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Regardless of what the calendar says, business owners MUST prioritize what matters to their customer base and more importantly, their bottom line. What we mean is, do not stress out if your November through December social media interactions and e-mail marketing open and click rates are not through the roof. Every dog has his day and these past 60 days may not have been your best. BUT there are still achievable and valuable goals you can attain in the realm of marketing that can help you stand out from big retailers.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Here are 4 ways to spread some holiday cheer to your customers using <a href="/affordable-email-marketing/" title="email marketing" target="_self">email marketing</a> and social media.</p>
<h3 class="x_MsoListParagraph"><span style="color: #840000;"><b>1.     </b><b>Offer</b> <b>Weekly Promotions Counting Down to the Holiday</b></span></h3>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Every one likes a little suspense as well as something to look forward to. So, plan for a month long of weekly promotions counting down to the big day.</p>
<h3 class="x_MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="color: #840000;"><b>Weekly Holiday Promotion Formula</b></span></h3>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" align="center">1 promotion per week &amp; 1 promotion per email</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"> Don’t overwhelm people OR your headlines. You’ve got a few seconds to resonate with them, so get to the point fast. <span> </span>Sprinkle a few give-a-ways in the mix as well just to spice it up. People like free stuff and to feel like they have a good chance of winning.</p>
<h3 class="x_MsoNormal"><span style="color: #840000;"><b>2.     </b><b>Link Social Media To Your E-Mail Marketing Campaign</b></span></h3>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">While it’s important to keep your email focused on one promotion, there’s nothing wrong with making your hyperlinks land on your social media pages instead of your website. Share tips for ways to save, photos, or share recipes. Determine a content type that yields the most response for Facebook interactions or ReTweets and stick with it. Tie this tactic back to your email and watch your reports to see if the people who opened it are the same ones interacting on social media.</p>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">Don’t worry about abandoning your website and possible conversions, especially if your conversions weren’t so impressive before. For every four or five posts/updates of non-business related content, add one of your holiday promotions that links to your website.</p>
<h3 class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span style="color: #840000;"><b>3.     </b><b>Create Landing Pages and Sync Your Google Resources</b></span></h3>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">Now that you’ve gotten them to your website, you have to close the sale or at least keep them there long enough to decide to purchase a product. This is where all the lessons you’ve learned on optimizing landing pages comes into play.

<h3 class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="color: #840000;"><b>4.     </b><b>Use Research to Drive Your Strategy</b></span></h3>
<p class="x_MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">Say for instance that the majority of your customer base is This particular topic is often forgotten, overlooked or completely ignored by some business owners. For whatever reason, people are afraid to get in the holiday spirit for fear of being politically incorrect and offending people. This is where knowing your customer base through marketing research really comes in handy. There are a number of tools available to you FOR FREE that will help you design a simple survey to integrate into your email marketing campaigns to gather demographic information.

(keep it simple stupid)!! Use this data to segment your lists and tailor your messages to the appropriate audiences that emerge from your data collecting efforts.</p>

      <title>How to Promote Your Business Blog Using Guest Blogging</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1324496526758" src="/Portals/123780/images/guest%20blogging-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="guest blogging" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">Guest blogging is a definite way to <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/74444/3-Ways-Creating-A-Corporate-Blog-Will-Bring-You-More-Business" title="promote your business blog" target="_self">promote your business blog</a>, gain new subscribers, and build relevant backlinks. The hardest part about guest blogging is actually finding a place to publish your blog where it will be seen by your target market. We’ll delve into that later in this blog, but right now we’re going to give a brief overview of what guest blogging actually is and some potential benefits.   </p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>What is Guest Blogging?</b></span></h3>
<p>Mutually beneficial relationships are by far the best relationships in business. And the same goes for guest blogging.</p>
<p>Guest blogging happens when a website owner publishes another bloggers content. It’s common courtesy for the website owner to give credit to the writer by listing a short bio at the end of the post. Providing links back to the bloggers websites is another best practice that will funnel visitors and <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="SEO" target="_self">SEO</a> link juice back to that bloggers sites. Therein lies the mutually beneficial relationship of guest blogging. You, the website owner, gets fresh content for your site and the blogger gets exposure and web visitors to their site. It’s that simple.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>Relationship Building</b></span></h3>
<p>Before you can ask someone to guest blog for you, you must first reach out to them. This can be tricky and definitely involves relationship building with the site owner or blogger. So, how do you do that? A good first step to this type of relationship building is to comment on and share some of their content through social media for about 3 weeks. This way, you’re sure to get on their radar and you’re publically endorsing their content. It’s also a great way to introduce your subscribers to content from a new source.</p>
<p>With that said, if you want the relationship to be fruitful, make sure your comments are of good substance and not just two to three word responses. Put some meat in your comments. Briefly explain how the material is beneficial to you and the value you think it has for your audiences. This isn’t brownnosing, it’s endorsing.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>Where Are the Bloggers?</b></span></h3>
<p>Before you can actually start guest blogging for websites, you must first find bloggers who write about topics related to yours. For example, if you own a gym that sells memberships and offers personal trainers, you should look for blogs that write about healthy living and weight loss.</p>
<p>There are a number of sites that make it easy to find guest bloggers. Here are four services that help you find them:</p>
<b>1.</b><b>    </b><b>MyBlogGuest</b><br><p>Recently, we (SearchDog Marketing) joined this site in an effort to expand our reach to Internet marketing bloggers and offer guest blogging opportunities. It’s a pretty straight-forward service that we believe has the potential to be powerful. The site is set up like a forum where bloggers can connect with one another and share content.</p>
<b>2.</b><b>    </b><b>Zementa</b><br><p>Word has it that <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/" title="Zementa" target="_self">Zementa</a> has been approved by Google as a white-hat service. They partnered with Wordpress and Blogger back in 2010 and even SEOmoz uses them for one very important reason – Zementa yields positive results.  This gist of Zementa is that publishers can submit a feed of content or images, which then appear is displayed in front of bloggers as they write their posts. These feeds of content appear as “related posts” that bloggers can then integrate into their post to improve branding, draw in direct links, and attract direct traffic from other bloggers. These “related posts” can also be listed at the bottom of your post for readers as well.</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, we’re testing out <a href="http://myblogguest.com" title="MyBlogGuest" target="_self">MyBlogGuest</a> and will soon venture over to Zementa. We’ll report back on what success we have.</p>

      <title>Saudi Prince Invests $300 Million In Twitter After Site Revamp</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1324306904296" src="/Portals/123780/images/princealwaleed-resized-600.jpeg" border="0" alt="Saudi Prince Invests in Twitter" width="357" height="535" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">After months of negotiations, billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and his investment company, Kingdom Holding Company (KHC), just announced plans to invest $300 million into Twitter. Alwaleed hopes to encourage more people to join the San Francisco-based micro blogging site and entice paying advertisers. This investment comes on the heels of Twitters most recent website revamp that seriously enhanced the site's look, feel and functionality. </p>
<p>According to the <em>Forbes’ </em>list of the world’s richest people, the Prince ranks 26<sup>th</sup>. This investment comes as no surprise to those who follow Alwaleeds investment prowess. His reach is widespread and constantly growing. According to their official statement, KHC holds a 29.9% stake in media and entertainment investments in the Arab world.</p>
<p>KHC’s executive director of private equity and international investments commented: "We believe that social media will fundamentally change the media industry landscape in the coming years. Twitter will capture and monetize this positive trend.”</p>
<p>After 5 years of growth, Twitter must have appeared ripe for investing to the Alwaleed, nephew of the Saudi king. Twitter currently has more than 100 million active users globally who post an average of 250 million tweets a day, according to KHC’s <a href="http://www.kingdom.com.sa/en/MC_PR_NewsDetails.asp?p=3&amp;z=3&amp;ID=905">official statement</a>.</p>
<p>The Prince had this to say, “Our investment in Twitter reaffirms our ability in identifying suitable opportunities to invest in promising, high-growth businesses with a global impact.” </p>
<p>This latest news is merely a continuation of Alwaleed and KHC’s investment into Western companies. The Prince stands as the main stakeholder in KHC, which in turn is a major stakeholder in Citigroup, Apple and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.</p>
<p>This deal seems like a win-win for the Prince, KHC and Twitter, but what does it mean for Twitter users? It remains to be seen, but we’ll keep a close eye out as it’s still unclear how much of Twitter the Saudi Prince will actually control.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/emarketer-resized-600.gif" border="0" alt="emarketer resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Twitter continues to keep tight reigns on its shareholders by maintaining a small group of private investors. While they are not required to release statements about their revenue earnings, it is obvious that Twitter will generate millions in 2012. In fact, according to a <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/PressRelease.aspx?R=1008617">statement</a> released by eMarketer, a research firm, it's estimated that Twitter will generate nearly $140 million in ad revenue at the close of 2011 and project $260 million in 2012.</p>

      <title>2 Amazing Twitter Analytics Tools To Help You Tweet More Effectively</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1325765530232" src="/Portals/123780/images/Twitter-Analytics-Tools-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Twitter Analytics Tools resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">Before you start to <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/83256/5-Tips-On-Making-The-Most-Out-of-Twitter-Marketing-For-Your-Business" title="create a Twitter strategy" target="_self">create a Twitter strategy</a>, it is important to have a pretty detailed account of who is actually following you and their behavior on Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter has yet to open their analytics tools up to the masses for free use, but several ambitious and visionary programmers have already designed code to provide insightful data for those of us who care. But not all programmers are equal, so we chose not to include them all in this post. We found that many analytics tools pull in the same information, but represent it differently.</p>
<p>Here are 2 amazing Twitter analytics tools that are user-friendly and provide great details on your followers and their tweets that you can actually use to create a serious strategy.</p>
<b>1.    </b><b>Know.Your.Followers. by Schmaps</b><br><p>If you ever wondered about what music your followers listen to or if they prefer to drink coffee or tea, there is an analysis tool that aggregates these details for you – Know Your Followers.</p>
<p>Created by Schmaps, which is best known for its real-time city guides and twitter service, Know Your Followers launched back in October 2011 allowing Twitter users to unlock a bevy of information about their followers. Of course, for a small fee, you can unlock even more information about your followers, but honestly, the free version will do just fine.</p>
<p>With the free version, you get a snapshot of your followers by location (country, US state and city), profession, basic demographics, likes and interests, and accounts followed.</p>
<p>After testing the free version of this tool, we have to say the insight it gives on your Twitter followers is pretty useful. We learned that the majority of my (@SearchDogMarket) followers are males, living in mainly in Georgia, they work for companies or organizations in sales/marketing and enjoy traveling, wining and dining.</p>
<b>2.    </b><b>Trendistic – See Trends in Twitter</b><br><p>If you like what Google Trends is doing for search queries, you are sure to appreciate <a href="http://trendistic.indextank.com/atlanta/_30-days">Trendistic</a> analytics, which offer trends of keywords or product names based on users tweets. Trendistic allows you to see the frequency of the keyword as it is mentioned over time. The different time intervals you can view range from real-time updates, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 month, 90 days and 180 days.</p>
<p>The information is laid out on an easily to understand graph similar to something you would see on Google Analytics. By clicking on a point on the graph, you can see tweets posted at a specific time. Trendistic also has the ability to do a trend comparison of two (or more) keywords. Lastly, you can embed these graphs on any website to SHOW your data instead of writing about it.</p>
<p>Between Know Your Followers and Trendistic, you should have a good sense of WHO is following you, WHAT they tweet, and WHEN they tweet it. Now use this data to connect with them. Feed them the type of content they desire based on their personal demographics and their own tweets.</p>

      <title>Social Media + Leveraging Celebrity Figures = Win For Your Business</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1323900042560" src="/Portals/123780/images/Celebrities%20and%20social%20media-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Celebrities and social media resized 600" width="350" height="302" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">The advent of reality television proves that people are interested in being more connected to celebrities. Social media provides a simple way to make this happen. Companies like Creative Recreation and bebe have recently launched social media campaigns to harness the power of celebrity and social media to build buzz.</p>
<p>Stylish and professional shoe company Creative Recreation leveraged connections with influencers like Perez Hilton, MTV, Robert Downey Jr. and Kanye West to build buzz about their brand.</p>
<p>bebe teamed up with The Kardashians to release their second bebe collection and help consumers connect with the brand. But how did they do it? It is one thing to state the objectives or results of a celebrity endorsed social media campaign, but it is quite another to actually implement one.</p>
<p>iCrossing had this to say:</p>
<p>"bebe is a perfect example of a brand that fully understands the value of having a connected marketing strategy," said Edmund Wong, senior vice president, strategy, iCrossing. "Their audience is young, hip and digitally-savvy. We continue to look for original and engaging ways to connect with these customers across all digital touch-points."</p>
<p>"Social media is a key component in our current marketing efforts," said Barbara Wambach, president of bebe direct. "iCrossing understands the bebe brand and the social spaces where our fans hang out. This insight allows us to leverage the different channels to connect with our customers."</p>
<p>Here’s how bebe did it:</p>
<p><b>They Enlisted the Help of Professionals</b></p>
<p>Embarking on a social media campaign with a celebrity endorsement is a major undertaking. Every business hopes for an opportunity to connect their brand with someone famous, but if it is truly worth the celebrity’s time and the company’s efforts, the campaign MUST be professionally designed.  </p>
<p>Since 2006, bebe has worked with <a href="http://www.icrossing.com/bebe-marketing-case-study">iCrossing</a> for digital marketing strategies. Over time, the two companies have come to understand that style is personal and shared. What better way to market the launch of their new collection than to create a ‘personal’ connection between the fashion-forward Kardashian sisters through social media.</p>
<p><b>The bebe Campaign</b></p>
<p>bebe developed a style-and social-savvy campaign that included Facebook updates, Twitter Q&amp;A with the Kardashians, blogger outreach and in-store promotions. They kept current and new bebe customers engaged with fan-only sneak-peaks, promotion opportunities and behind-the-scenes updates.</p>
<p><b>The Results</b></p>
<p>bebe managed to increase their Twitter followers by 59%, <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/109963/Edgerank-Score-What-is-it-and-How-Does-It-Effect-My-Facebook-Page" title="boost in Facebook fans" target="_self">boost in Facebook fans</a> by 23% and receive 10-20K clicks per tweet.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a small business owner who doesn’t have a million dollar marketing budget, hiring a celebrity for a social media campaign is obviously unrealistic. What is a more realistic approach for businesses is to leverage reality television shows and online discussions they generate on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Millions of viewers tune in to reality television every night and have conversations about what they see. This is the perfect opportunity for you to create a campaign that aligns with a popular reality show that your businesses target market follows.</p>
<p><b>Example: </b></p>
<p>A vintage boutique in Decatur, Georgia that specializing in women’s clothing could design a campaign around a spin on Bravo’s Real Housewives show to find “The Real Fashonistas of Decatur.” Women pay close attention to the Real Housewives fashion and this would be a great time to use that to bring attention to the fashionable clothing your boutique offers that’s similar to styles seen on the show.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<p><b>Offer Exclusive Content</b></p>
<p>People want to feel like they are in on something exclusive that not every person has access to. Exclusive content is key to growing your community online and creating a sort of bond (superficial or not) with your fans. People will continue to come back to engage in some way. bebe offered behind-the-scenes updates and fan only sneak previews. What can you offer your current and future customers to keep them coming back?</p>
<p><b>In-Store Promotion</b></p>
<p>You MUST connect the customers who are coming into your store back to the <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing" title="social media campaign" target="_self">social media campaign</a>. The campaign exists on the Internet, so you must leave breadcrumbs to lead these customers where their interest in the product is reflected on the campaign. There are a number of ways to do this. You could try leaving a message on the receipt, flyers, posters, and verbal reminders by staff, etc.</p>
<p><b>Use HashTags</b></p>
<p>The Twitter Q&amp;A really stands out to us because that resulted in 10-20K clicks per tweet. The Kardashians have an overwhelming number of Twitter followers who are literally watching their every word. While your business probably won’t have millions of fans and followers, you can become a part of the ongoing conversation about a reality television show by using their endorsed hashtag. You’ll get the attention of people who are tweeting about this worldwide. You can also come up with your own hashtag and promote that to your customers and prospective customers.</p>

      <title>Edgerank Score: What is it and How Does It Effect My Facebook Page? </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1323756157655" src="/Portals/123780/images/Facebook%20Edgerank%20Score-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Facebook Edgerank Score resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">Growing your Facebook fan base can be a difficult and time-consuming task for a business owner with a million other things on their plate. Facebook business page owners are tasked with having to gain fans, as well as keep them engaged.</p>
<p>It can be tricky to decide what content will be best received by your fans, because they are all interested in different things. Facebook is designed so that newer, fresher content appears on a fan’s newsfeed, which is how they stay informed of recent updates. EdgeRank is the algorithm that Facebook uses to prioritize posts in a user’s newsfeed.</p>
<p>Every piece of content you post to your business Facebook page is assigned a score in EdgeRank. The higher the score, the more likely you are to appear in users’ newsfeed, which in turn increases the chance that your Facebook fans will interact with your company’s page.</p>
<p>It is important to know how Facebook’s EdgeRank algorithm works so your content continues to appear in your fans newsfeed. Understanding EdgeRank gets your content in front of your users faces so they have an opportunity to interact. With no window of opportunity, there is no interaction or subsequent engagement. Without this awareness, your content will always remain unseen by your target.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #a30000;"><b>How Are EdgeRank Scores Determined?</b></span></h2>
<p>There are 3 factors that determine EdgeRank Scores:<b> </b></p>
<b></b><span style="color: #a30000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1.    </b><b>Affinity: </b></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px;">Every Facebook fan interacts with your company’s <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Facebook page at a different rate. The Affinity Score measures HOW <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>OFTEN a fan and his friends interact with the page’s content. The more <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>shares, comments, likes and overall interactions fans have with a <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>business page, the faster the Affinity score increases.</span>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px;"></span><span style="color: #a30000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2.    </b><b>Time: </b></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px;">How old is your content? If you post once a week, this will <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>lower your EdgeRank score. The freshest content receives the highest <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>time score. The longer it’s been since you posted fresh content, the <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>less relevant your content becomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px;"></span><span style="color: #a30000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3.    </b><b>Weight: </b></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px;">Different types of content are weighted differently in <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>EdgeRank. Some people like and comment on pictures and videos more <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>than simple text updates and vice versa. EdgeRank measures and <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>weighs each fans behavior to determine what type of content to rank <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>highest in their news feed. So, if a fan interacts with pictures and <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>videos more than anything else, EdgeRank assigns higher weight scores <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>to those types of content.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The best way to ensure you are covering all 3 of these bases is to simply keep your <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>content FRESH and DIVERSE!<b> <br></b></p>
<h2><b><span style="color: #a30000;">How can I Improve My EdgeRank Score?</span> </b></h2>
<p><b></b><span style="color: #a30000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1.    </b><b>Post Likeable and Sharable Content </b></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;">– When you’re thinking about <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>what to post, don’t just think about yourself. You want people to <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>interact with your content, so publish things that they care about, not <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>just sales pitches and things relevant to your business or industry. <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Encourage fans to share content, ideas and input. People love to give <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>their two cents about any and everything. <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing" title="Social media" target="_self">Social media</a> sites have <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>become the number one place for consumers to complain, but this <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>presents a great opportunity for businesses to channel this into <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>something positive for their EdgeRank score.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="color: #a30000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2.    </b></span><b><span style="color: #a30000;">Give Things Away</span> – </b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;">Everyone knows people like free stuff, so give <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>stuff away! You own a business that either produces something or <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>offers services that people need or want. People will definitely share a <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>good deal, like a discount or free advice from a professional.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="color: #a30000;"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3.    </b></span><b><span style="color: #a30000;">Schedule Posts In Advance</span> – </b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;">Come up with 7 updates to post <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>for each week of the current or upcoming month (make sure they <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>follow number 1 and number 2).

      <title>How To Increase Traffic To Your Company's Blog Using Google Trends</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>In May 2011, <a href="http://www.comscoredatamine.com/2011/06/google-reaches-1-billion-global-visitors/">comScore</a> estimated that Google averages a reach of 1 billion unique visitors per month. If you’re a loyal user of Google Search, you can only imagine the vast number of daily hits Google receives from unique and returning visitors. Wouldn’t it be great if you had insight into that search data? Are you curious about what people are searching for on any given day?</p>
<p>Well, you’re in luck, because Google is nice enough to roll out fresh keyword search data on a daily basis for anyone to find through <a href="http://www.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a>.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll give you an overview of what Google Trends is and ways it can be used to increase search engine rankings.</p>
<h3>
<strong> <img src="/Portals/123780/images/increase%20traffic%20using%20Google%20trends-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="increase traffic using Google trends resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;"><span style="color: #ad0000;">W</span></strong><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>hat is Google Trends</b></span>
</h3>
<p>Google Trends can tell you what keywords are most popular in different geographical locations on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When you go to the main Google Trends website, it’ll show you a list of the most popular searches for the day. You can also perform a search for whatever keywords you want. Just type in your phrase, hit Search Trends, and wait for the results. Keep in mind that the numbers on the Search Volume Index graph do not reflect actual search traffic numbers. Instead the Search Volume Index represents the average search traffic in the chosen time period.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>Google Measures the ‘Hotness’ of Keyword Searches</b></span></h3>
<p>Hot Searches show the top 20 search queries that experience sudden surges in popularity. They allow you to see a snapshot of what’s important to the public without having a middleman or gatekeeper interpret the information for you. In addition to being able to see what’s hot right now, you can look at past dates as well.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>How Hot Searches Work</b></span></h3>
<p>Google uses an algorithm that analyzes millions of web searches and filters out spam. These searches are updated every hour. For each search, Hot Search will show you the Search Volume Index graph, news, blog posts, and web results to help you understand why a search is listed there.</p>
<p>Now that you’re familiar with the features of Google Trends, here are a few tips for how to boost your search engine optimization rankings by using Google Trends data. Keep in mind that your usual SEO strategies and tactics still apply.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>Use Keywords in Blog Titles and Body Copy</b></span></h3>
<p>You’ve been told time and time again to use keywords in your headlines and body copy, right? We’re telling you to apply that same knowledge using Google Trends keywords and you’re sure to see a boost in your inbound web traffic. Look for keywords that are trending high, but have low search density. When we say low search density, we mean between 400K and 100K results. Remember, Google Trends does not report overall search data, only an average of broad search patterns.</p>
<p>Use these keywords in your blog titles and body copy and you could be listed in the Trends results and Google search results.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>Incorporate Topics Into Your Niche</b></span></h3>
<p>Consider this scenario: You blog for a communications firm that wants to find a way to capitalize on Google Trend keywords to boost your SEO. The terrible events that took place at Virginia Tech are still getting lots of searches online right now, but you can’t figure out a way piggyback on it.</p>
<p>Instead of directly reporting on the event, you can report on the way VT communicators used social media and technology as part of their crisis communications plan. Your story is filled with keyword data from Google Trends and you managed to make the topic relevant to your niche. Do this for other keywords and watch your web traffic rise.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to know what people are searching for, but Google Trends makes it easy for us. Bloggers, and anyone for that matter, should use Google Trends search query data to increase your chances of being found by the folks who are ALREADY searching for popular keywords. By integrating keywords from Trends into your <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="SEO strategy" target="_self">SEO strategy</a>, you’re simply putting your content where Google Searchers can find it.</p>

      <title>3 Tips To Help Businesses Engage Their Customers on Google+</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1323292013045" src="/Portals/123780/images/Engage%20Customers%20on%20Google--resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Engage Customers on Google  resized 600" width="229" height="281" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">As many of you know, Google just created it’s own social network, Google+, and very recently added business pages. Yes, this is yet another social network to maintain and try to gain leverage on. The good news is that Google has a few unique features that set it apart from Facebook, so there’s definitely just cause to join.</p>
<p>The art of engagement on social media is a tricky one to say the least. While the introduction of Google+ brings new challenges and opportunities for business owners and marketers alike, it also presents social media challenges that we’re all too familiar with like… (drum roll please) … engagement.</p>
<p>Engagement is by far one of the top goals for any legitimate <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing" title="social media campaign" target="_self">social media campaign</a>. Engagement takes constant nurturing and environmental monitoring to master. Every situation and audience is different and not all tactics will work for every business. However, there are a few basic ways to set your business up for success with Google+, specifically due to its unique features. So here are the 3 rules to the art of engagement on Google+.</p>
<p><b>1.    </b><b>Visual Content is King</b></p>
<p>Take a look at any successful Google+ business page and you’ll see they have one very obvious thing in common – they all share lots of PHOTOS. </p>
<p>What type of photos you ask? Humorous, unique, and non-vulgar are a few characteristics, but what you share really depends on WHO you’re sharing with. All your followers don’t want the same information shared with them so take time to account for different interest, industries, etc.</p>
<p>Also, unlike Facebook, which allows you to upload dozens of photos at once, Google+ only lets users upload photos individually. So think about infographics, charts, slides, etc. that would spark an interesting exchange between you and those in your circle. Ask yourself: what would catch my attention or the attention of people I know? Then, find them on Google+, add them to a circle and start sharing.</p>
<p>Please note that every photo you share doesn’t have to be directly related to your business. Break up the monotony every once in a while and share something from pop culture that is NOT offensive to people. It’s a pretty good rule of thumb to stay away from issues involving religion, sexual orientation or other sensitive subjects. The already established social media rules definitely still apply in this new arena.</p>
<p><b>2.    </b><b>Sharing and Segmentation are Key</b></p>
<p>Marketing experts agree that Circles are currently the biggest selling point of Google+. Google is of the belief that different people desire different content and so are we. Segmenting messages is a great way to not tick off customers and business colleagues with content that’s only relevant to a particular segment of your target.</p>
<p>Circles were mentioned in the previous paragraph, so allow me to explain for those of you who have yet to research the basics of Google+.</p>
<p>On Facebook and Twitter, you have ‘groups’ and/or ‘lists’ as a way to segment your friends, right? Well, on Google+ you can create Circles to segment your friends into different groups. There are some preloaded Circle labels, but you can create new labels as needed. People can be added to more than one Circle, so you’re in control of who you communicate with. I suggest creating Circles for everyone in your life, since basically everyone can have a Google+ page.<span style="color: #ad0000;"><b> </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b></b></span><b>3.    </b><b>Hangouts – The Game Changer</b></p>
<p>Never before has a social media site attempted what Google+ has successfully accomplished, which is the integration of a video conferencing featured called Hangouts. Google+ business page owners can install Google voice and a video plugin and instantly see their followers. Although Google+ is still in it’s infancy, Hangouts bring a whole new advantage to marketing with Google+ business pages.</p>
<p>How you ask? Think about all those times you wanted to ask a customer what they thought about a new product or policy change. There are a number of ways to engage customers in this type of discussion: Survey Money, focus groups, questionnaires, and even Facebook applications. Hangouts do not eliminate the need for these types of tools, but it definitely adds a new crayon to the box. So, use it cautiously and wisely. But USE IT. </p>
<p>These are just a few marketing tips for Google+ business pages. As Google adds continues to add to its suite of features. They’ve already given us a heads up that analytics tools, ownership transfer and page analytics are next up. Once those roll out, we’ll let you know what marketing benefits they hold for businesses.</p>

      <title>What Small Business Owners Must Know About SEO &amp; Keyword Competition </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1323463458189" src="/Portals/123780/images/small%20business%20keyword-research-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="small business keyword research resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>If you own a local business, you have competitors and concerns about losing a percentage of your profits to them. Not only do you have to worry about your competition on the ground, you have to be concerned about losing leverage on the Internet due to poor search engine optimization. Even if you know very little about SEO, if you own a business and have a website, you probably already know that a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strong <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="SEO campaign" target="_self">SEO campaign</a></span> has the ability to lift your website from the depths of the online marketplace to the top of any search results.</p>
<p>But without an <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">active </span></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SEO campaign</span> (and by active we mean constantly researching, monitoring, analyzing, and evaluating your performance), your competitors will catch up and overtake your search results. Leaving you, your products or services, and that lovely blog you poured over for hours, far from the top of the totem pole. This is why you have yet to make a lot of sales from your business website. This is why customers never come in and say they read about something on your website after searching the Internet. They simply cannot find you.</p>
<p>The secret to your businesses success in search engine optimization lies in a combination of factors, but for the purposes of this blog we’re only zeroing in on one – keywords. Yes, the magical buzzword of SEO. Not just any keywords though and definitely not one-word keywords. We’re talking <span style="text-decoration: underline;">long-tail keywords phrases</span>, phrases that include 3 to 5 words within the phrase.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>Highly Searched Keywords Aren't Always Better</b></span></h3>
<p>It's true, one or two word broad keywords generally get searched more often, but they tend to be very broad in nature and not specific to a particular product or service. Also these broad keywords can often be much more difficult to rank for as opposed to longtail phrases. </p>
<p>With their lower ranking difficulty and high specifity, longtail keywords are the key to quicker profits.  When it comes to keyword research, you want to be sure you’re investing time and money in words that are laser targeted to your business (the more specific the better), get a healthy amount of search traffic, and aren't extremely competitive to rank for.</p>
<p>Here's an example of broad to longtail keyword phrases starting with broader first:</p>
<p>Florist</p>
<p>Atlanta Florist</p>
<p>Atlanta Florist Delivery</p>
Atlanta Florist delivery service
<p>To help you determine how difficult it will be to rank for these phrases, try doing a Google search for your phrase to see who the top ranking competitors are.  Do they have the keyword phrase in their title tag, in their description, in there url?  Answering these questions will give you clues as to whether or not these sites are optimized for these terms.</p>
<p>Also SEOmoz has a great <a href="http://pro.seomoz.org/tools/keyword-difficulty" title="keyword difficulty tool" target="_self">keyword difficulty tool</a> that gives the ranking difficulty for different keywords, and <a href="http://www.marketsamurai.com/" title="Market samurai" target="_self">Market samurai</a> is another great tool to help you gage your SEO competition for each keyword phrase. Using these tools will help you find the best keywords to target for your SEO efforts, the ideal combination is a high number of searches with low difficulty.</p>
So the moral of this story is, you need to select your keywords carefully.  Here's a quick rundown on exactly how to go about finding your most profitable keywords:<ol>
<li>Research your main broad keywords ex: florist, using the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" title="Google keyword tool" target="_self">Google keyword tool</a>, and find longtail versions of these keywords that are more specific to your business and get a healthy number of searches/month ex: Downtown Atlanta Florist</li>
<li>Create a list of these longtail phrases and separate them by theme</li>
<li>Take your list and insert them into tools like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SEOmoz Keyword Difficulty Tool</span> and Market samurai to determine how difficult it will be to rank for each keyword phrase</li>
<li>Pick your top 5 and launch your campaign</li>
</ol>
<p>This 4-step process will help you get on the road to success in search engine optimization for your business website. Great SEO involves constantly monitoring, analyzing, researching and evaluating your progress AND your competition.</p>

      <title>Black Friday and Social Media - How To Create A Win-Win Situation</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1322841497397" src="/Portals/123780/images/black%20friday%20social%20offer-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Black Friday and Social Media" width="299" height="214" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">If you found yourself visiting the Facebook or Twitter page of a major retailer for exclusive Black Friday sales, you benefited from a successful, holiday, social (media) offer. </p>
<p>Stores like CVS Pharmacy, Radio Shack, Toys R Us, and a few other retailers leveraged their social media relationship this holiday season by offering exclusive deals to their customers. These companies were able offer significant savings with relatively low overhead costs. In marketing, that’s the epitome of a win-win situation and it goes a pretty long way toward building your brand. So, here’s a the Black Friday social offers that stood out to us.</p>
<p>Black Friday Social Offers:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/toysrus?sk=app_219526864781254">Toys R Us</a> used Facebook to create a scavenger hunt sweepstakes. Customers played for a chance to win a $25 gift card.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/walmart?sk=app_216359575057664">Walmart</a> helped their Facebook fans navigate the isles and find their favorite deal by offering maps of the local store.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/CVS">CVS Pharmacy</a> customers and Facebook fans took a holiday shopping quiz and got a 20% off coupon. Not only that, they held gift card giveaway contests on Twitter to engage followers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sears?sk=app_150078195092499">Sears</a> created a Holiday Shopping Challenge for their Facebook fans to win a $200 gift card.</p>
<p>Just by looking at what these retailers have done, we can see two emerging strategies are evident – 1) create a tangible, valuable gain and 2) create a call to action.</p>
<p>Instead of spending hours trying to find ways to engage people with strategies that have no value or connection to your bottom line, try creating a strategy that directly ties to it. We’re surprised to see how many businesses are not doing this at all or are doing it poorly.</p>
<p>Here are 4 steps to constructing a social media offer:</p>
<p><b>1)    </b><b>Define your business goals. </b></p>
<p>Ask yourself this, why is your business using <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing" title="social media marketing" target="_self">social media marketing</a>? What is the link to your bottom line? What do you hope to accomplish? From there, create specific and measurable goals.</p>
<p><b>2)    </b><b>Define your social media goals. </b></p>
<p>What do you hope to achieve in each social media environment?  People use each social media site for different things, so think about what your prospect is using each channel for and figure out how to connect with them in that state of mind.  Again, create specific and measurable goals.</p>
<p><b>3)    </b><b>Know your audience. </b></p>
<p>The simple fact is that your online audience may or may not be your actual customer. It’s still good to know who they are, because these are already established relationships. If your followers aren’t your actual customers, you must track them down in whatever online communities they frequent (LinkedIn groups, Facebook groups, and other opt in communities are a good start). <a href="http://schmap.it/know-your-followers">Know.Your.Followers</a> is a website that analyzes your current followers and groups them into categories for free.</p>
<p><b>4)    </b><b>Monitor their online behavior and connections.</b></p>
<p>Once you’ve found your audience, you need to get to know them as much as possible. Look at who they follow, who follows them, what they share or retweet, and what businesses they are connected with. This will give you a good idea of what they want from a business in the social media environment.</p>
<p><b>5)    </b><b>Design your social offer.</b></p>
<p>Gather takeaways and come up with a unique strategy based on your products and services. There’s nothing wrong with seeing what a competitor has done and deciding if it can work for your business. But do not shortchange yourself, your business, or your customers by copying someone else’s exact offer. Come up with something that addresses your customers needs and they will respond. Simple.</p>

      <title>5 Pay Per Click Metrics That Matter To Your Business</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>1.     </b><b>Quality</b><b> Score</b></span></h3>
<p>Quality Score is Google’s self-designed grading system that evaluates your ads and judges them with a score. Your AdWords Quality Score is mostly determined by <b>relevance</b>.</p>
<p>Factors that affect Quality Score include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Relevance of ad copy to the keyword</b> – Is the ad text connected with the keyword?</li>
<li>
<b>Relevance of ad to corresponding landing page</b> – Does clicking the ad take you to a website page that matches what the advertisement is promoting?</li>
<li>
<b>Click-through rate (CTR) </b>–<b> </b>How often an ad is clicked on after appearing. If your ad is displayed often but clicked rarely, your ad might not be relevant.<b></b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Historical account performance</b> – How old is your account and has it performed well over time?<b></b>
</li>
<li><b>Other relevance and performance factors</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Relevance is a huge deal to Google. They want searchers to have a great experience on Google by connecting users’ search queries with ads that are relevant to what they are searching for.</p>
<p>Imagine searching Google for “lobster oven mitts.” How annoyed would you be if you were shown ads selling stainless steel ovens or live lobsters? What if the ads made no sense at all and were for things like “life insurance” simply because someone paid a lot of money to get the ad posted? Searchers would get fed up and it’d make for an all around negative user experience.</p>
<p>The internet is all about instantaneous response—people use search engines to find what they want, when they want it. Google wants to provide the best search experience by giving the people what they want. And that’s done by encouraging advertisers to adhere to relevance.</p>
<p>Because relevance is so important to Google, they reward advertisers who focus on Quality Score with lower advertising costs and better exposure, making it an immensely important PPC metric.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>2.     </b><b>Landing Page Optimization</b></span></h3>
<p>It’s incredibly important that your advertisements take searchers to a landing page that is connected with the ad. One mistake PPC beginners sometimes make is linking all their advertisements to their homepage. Sending people to your homepage is like plopping a tiny rowboat in the middle of The Perfect Storm. They have no idea how they got there and have no clue where to go. Dumping visitors at the homepage forces them to dig through your site trying to find what you promised in your advertisement. Instead they’ll most likely jump back to Google and try again, erasing any chance you had of making a conversion.</p>
<p><b>Create tailored landing pages that deliver what your ad text offers</b>. If you’re a bakery advertising sticky buns, bring them to those sticky buns!  If you promised free shipping, put a note about that on your landing page as well.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me about these:</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/ppc%20metrics-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="ppc metrics resized 600"></p>
<p>But then take me to this: </p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/pay%20per%20click%20metrics-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="pay per click metrics resized 600"></p>
<p>The internet is too full of alternative choices—you need to streamline the process for your visitors, because it’s simply too convenient for them to turn around and find someone who <em>will </em>make it easy.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>3.     </b><b>Negative Keywords</b></span></h3>
<p>Negative keywords can save you tons of money and are an essential element of a successful keyword list. Unlike keywords, which are terms you are bidding on, negative keywords are specific words that you do <em>not</em> want to have your ad show up for.</p>
<p>For example, say you are selling water bottles. Maybe you’re still new to the business and only have a limited selection of water bottle models. If you’re bidding on water bottles with broad-match set, you can appear for “sturdy water bottles,” and “plastic water bottles,” which might be perfect for you. But you won’t want to have your ad appear for “stainless steel water bottles” or “water bottles with built in straw” if you don’t offer those. Setting those terms as negative keywords solves your problem!</p>
<p>Using Negative Keywords can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent your ad from being triggered by irrelevant search queries.</li>
<li>Connect you with relevant audiences who are more likely to make conversions.</li>
<li>Stop money from being wasted on unwanted impressions and clicks from irrelevant searches.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of paid and free <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/negative-keywords">negative keyword tools</a> that can help you come up with negative keywords.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>4.     </b><b>Account Activity</b></span></h3>
<p>If you’ve ever grown a garden, you know that those delicious tomatoes and beautiful sunflowers don’t come without some work. Gardening is not as simple as throwing some seeds in the ground, doing a rain dance, and calling it a day—success requires constant attention and care.</p>
<p>PPC isn’t really so different from gardening. Some people think you can toss some keywords into AdWords, throw a couple ad groups together, and you’re set. But you won’t be winning any prizes at the county fair for those campaigns.</p>
<p>To truly be successful with PPC, you must <b>constantly be analyzing and reacting to your data</b>. See what keywords are working for you and which ones are underperforming. Test different ad text, try changing your ad groups. The more you test, the more you can see what is or isn’t working in your campaigns, and then improve as a result.</p>
<p>If you haven’t set up <b>conversion tracking</b>, do it ASAP. Conversion tracking with AdWords allows you to keep track of how many clicks to your site go on to make desirable actions, whether that’s joining a mailing list or making a purchase.</p>
<p>Without conversion tracking enabled, you can’t test and learn what you are doing right (or wrong). Half of the clients we talk with don’t have conversion tracking enabled, and it’s a shame because it’s such a useful tool. <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=86283&amp;from=6331&amp;rd=1">Setting up conversion tracking</a> is easy and 100% free!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ad0000;"><b>5.     </b><b>Long-Tail Keyword Optimization</b></span></h3>
<p>The problem with broad, one-word keywords is that everyone and their mom are bidding on them. These words end up being extremely competitive and expensive. The better choice is to focus on long-tail keywords, which are made up of three words or more. These are <b>cheaper, less competitive, and drive more relevant traffic</b>.</p>
<p>Say you are selling gourmet soup. Even while soup isn’t exactly a cut-throat industry, you can bet there are a fair number of people bidding on the keyword “soup.” Think about longer keywords you can use.  What kind of soups do you sell? How about bidding on the keyword “tomato bisque soup”? You’ll have less competition and pay less money for that keyword.</p>
<p>Long-tail keywords can also improve your click-through-rate since only you and a few others are matching these more specific search queries. This also means a higher chance of conversion since you are giving the searcher <em>exactly</em> what they are looking for.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, long-tail keywords are less competitive, drive the most relevant traffic, and save you money. What’s not to love about these kooky guys?</p>
<p>Keep in mind these essential PPC metrics , and you’ll see tremendous improvement in your PPC campaigns.</p>
<p>If you’re not quite sure where to start, one great tool you can use to help improve your campaign is <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/google-adwords">WordStream’s AdWords Performance Grader</a>—it’s a <b>free tool that grades your AdWords account</b> on the PPC metrics we discussed today, and shows you exactly how and where to make improvements.</p>

      <title>Yahoo Site Explorer Closes: A Dark Day for SEO Consultants</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1325766550053" src="/Portals/123780/images/Yahoo-Site-explorer-closed-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="Yahoo Site explorer closed resized 600" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">November 21 was a dark day for some SEO consultants who depended on <a href="http://searchengineland.com/library/yahoo/yahoo-site-explorer">Yahoo Site Explorer</a>. Back in October, Yahoo announced plans to do away with its much beloved SEO tools and on November 21 they hammered the final nail in the coffin by officially closing the site. What the SEO crowd misses is the detailed link data, which provided a look at a website’s back links.</p>
<p>Yahoo suggests that we all move to <a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster/">Bing Webmaster Tools</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>to get high quality organic search traffic from Bing and Yahoo!. A huge downside to Bing Webmaster Tools is that it doesn’t provide information about sites they do not own. So, we at Search Dog Marketing are interested in what you (the readers, <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="SEO consultants" target="_self">SEO consultants</a>) think about this now that you’ve had a chance to check out what Bing has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>According to Yahoo:</strong></p>
<p>The Bing Webmaster Center team has been actively adding new features over the past few months, including detailed traffic statistics and a new inbound links feature. Microsoft is also committed to build analytic reports that include Yahoo! search usage.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a plethora of third party tools that allow us to retrieve this back link data, such as SEOmoz. Last year, SEOmoz stepped up with what it hoped would be a sufficient replacement/competitor to Yahoo Site Explorer called <a href="http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/">Open Site Explorer.</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>It pulls data points from SEOmoz’s web index and Linkscape tool.</p>
<p>Other Yahoo Site Explorer alternatives are, <a href="http://www.majesticseo.com/">Majestic Site Explorer</a> and <a href="http://www.link-assistant.com/seo-spyglass/">SEO Spyglass</a>.</p>
<p>So, what tools/sites are you using now that Yahoo Site Explorer is off the market? What are some pros and cons?</p>

      <title>3 Common Email Marketing Mistakes That Lead to Unsubscribes</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><img id="img-1325766593609" src="/Portals/123780/images/email%20marketing%20mistakes-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="email marketing mistakes" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br>With the growth of social media as a viable</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">tool for B2B marketers, it is still important not to discount the power of e-mail marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">E-mail marketing remains a cost-effective solution to lead generation. Used wisely in a balanced marketing mix, it has the potential to build long-lasting relationships with your clients. There are a number of 3</span><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">rd</span></sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> party websites that help you design, manage your lists, and publish your e-mail marketing campaign. They’re all reasonably effective, give or take a few features here and there. Ultimately, how effective your email marketing strategy is depends on the YOUR planning and follow-through.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The absolute worst feeling in the world is spending hours creating content, laying out designs, tweaking code, and embedding links to find out few people opened it - or worse – they unsubscribed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The sad part is that it is not the client’s fault they unsubscribed. Blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the marketer. So, avoid this unfortunate fate by reading 3 Commons E-Mail Marketing Mistakes that Lead to Unsubscribes.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Arial, serif; color: #d60000;"><b>Zero Nurturing</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The first e-mail you send a new subscriber should NOT be a sales pitch. Whatever e-mail marketing provider you decide to use should definitely include some type of lead nurturing software that will help manage your contacts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Your clients are all different, they like to purchase different products and services, they have different names, live in different locations, have different birthdays, some are new clients and some are regulars. So, segment your lists accordingly. It’s rude and presumptuous to rush to 3</span><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">rd</span></sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> base on your 1</span><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">st</span></sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> date, so pace yourself. Offer a carrot in the first email. If they like it, chances are they won’t unsubscribe.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Arial, serif; color: #d60000;"><b>Lack of Goal Definition</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Before you can even think about starting an </span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">e-mail marketing campaign,</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> you must decide on what goals you want to accomplish. Too many times, B2B marketers fire off e-mail blasts without really thinking through what they want to achieve or what success is for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Before you start working on content for e-mail, sit down and answer these three questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">What do I hope to achieve with this campaign? </span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><em>Is it more leads, awareness building, market penetration; introduce a new product, etc.</em></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">How many e-mails will it take to accomplish my campaign goal? </span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><em>Sending multiple e-mails to a small list is suicide. It won’t take long to turn-off these clients, so designate a small number of emails (3 or less) to send to your target group.</em></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol><ol type="a">
<li>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><em>Ex. Product Introduction – send an email before the product hits the market, as it hits the market, then a few weeks after the launch to remind clients and get feedback. That’s really all it takes, either they’re interested or they’re not. Don’t become a spammer by trying to force people to open an email, because what you’re forcing them to do is unsubscribe.</em></span></p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Are there other e-mails you plan to send to clients this month? </span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><em>I see big department stores make this mistake all the time with e-mail marketing. They send multiple e-mails in the span of 30 days that all contain different messages with different call to actions. This practice inundates client’s inboxes, but also creates message confusion.</em></span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, serif; color: #d60000;"><b>Bad Marketing Automation</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">There’s nothing worse than opening an e-mail from a business and seeing this “Dear &lt;First Name&gt;.” </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It’s the tell tell sign that someone hasn’t taken enough time to double and triple check their work. It also says to the client, “I’m just a customer” and that’s not the message you want to send.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The simple solution to this is sending a test email to yourself and other people you work with. Taking the extra time to do this will go a long way with customers and increase your chances of generating leads.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">These were 3 common e-mail marketing mistakes that lead to unsubscribes, but there are hundreds more we could have presented.</span></p>

      <title>[Infographic] Learn How The Google Adwords Auction Process Works</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Here is a cool new infographic from the guys over at <a href="http://www.wordstream.com" title="Wordstream" target="_self">Wordstream</a>, a company that creates pay per click management software and keyword research tools.</p>
<p>This infographic gives you a visual look at how the Google Adwords auction process works.  When I think of auction my mind always goes to placing a bid on a product and if you have the highest bid you get the product your bidding on.  Well Google's pay per click auction process works a little differently in that the item you are bidding on is your ad position, and there are multiple factors that go into actually winning that prized position other than just the amount you're bidding.</p>
<p>At this point you might be a little confused, but this very informative graphic should clear things up a bit for you.  It will show you the multiple factors mentioned above and how they come into play in the adwords bidding process.  This information is great for companies out their that might not know about Adwords or you want to be able to lower the costs of your <a href="/guide-to-search-advertising/" title="Google Adwords PPC campaign" target="_self">Google Adwords PPC campaign</a>. </p>

      <title>3 Deadly Web Design Mistakes Small Businesses Make</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1321465830966" src="/Portals/123780/images/Web%20Design%20Mistakes-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Web Design Mistakes resized 600" width="186" height="185" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;">You spend thousands of dollars and countless from your marketing budget on a Web site that gets few visits from people outside of your business. This is the unfortunate reality for many small businesses who have taken the time and money to invest in a Web site, but are still guilty of these three basic web design mistakes.<b> <br></b></p>
<h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>1.    </b><b>Poor Navigation Structure</b></span></h2>
<ol></ol>
<p>Understanding how people navigate your site is critical to your Web site’s success in providing information to the user and achieving your bottom line. Make no mistake, poorly structured sites are both obvious and annoying to users. It also reflects poorly on your business and brand. If users can’t find what they need FAST, they’ll go somewhere else. Before you know it, your site’s analytics will start reporting short visit times on your site (0:08, 0:15) and poor navigation structure is the cause. When people visit your site, they are in search of information and they want it fast and simple. A good navigation structure is seamless and manages to keep users on your site longer, which can lead to more leads, readers, and subscribers.</p>
<h3><strong>Navigation Guidelines:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Group related links. Place links that are most important to the user on the top navigation bar and leave the functional stuff (account settings, copyright, etc.) somewhere out of direct sight.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use Breadcrumb navigation to help users understand where they are in the site and how to get out.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don’t organize a Web site based on your internal business structure; rather how your target audience wants the information arranged.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>2.    </b><b>Writing for Print vs. Web</b></span></h2>
<ol></ol>
<p>A huge mistake many small businesses make is taking their information for their site directly from a brochure, business plan or other PRINTED publication. This is deadly to your Web site, because writing for the web is very different than writing for print. Web content is more fast-paced, because users are hunting for a SOLUTION, not a story. The storytelling approach on the web often feels like filler text and slows down the user. Keep your web content brief and get to the point quickly or you will lose your reader.</p>
<h3><strong>How to write for the web:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Write TIGHT. Get to the point quickly.</li>
<li>Avoid large blogs of copy – you’re not writing a novel or short story. One – to – two sentence paragraphs or fragments are perfectly acceptable.</li>
<li>Use active voice. Be energetic and descriptive. Use action verbs and strong adjectives.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>3.    </b><b>Clutter</b></span></h2>
<ol></ol>
<p><img id="img-1321466085507" src="/Portals/123780/images/website%20clutter-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Website Clutter" width="430" height="323" class="alignCenter" style="height: 243px; width: 430px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Users attention span is very short. On average, they spend 4.4 seconds for every extra 100 words on a page. Which means cluttering your site with too much information is deadly to your bottom line. If you’ve seen one site guilty of this you understand exactly what we mean by ‘clutter.’ A website is not a place to dump every single detail about your company. Doing this results in an overly busy page and people simply aren’t going to spend a large amount of time trying to find what they need. Ultimately, clutter leads to low traffic, a high bounce rate and potentially a poor Page Rank.          </p>
<h3><strong>Basic guidelines to decrease clutter:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize your site content based on what is most important to your visitor and potential customer, NOT YOU. Web sites are designed for the user, so it makes sense that you should build it around their needs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Distinguish between different areas of content to make it easier for the user to understand and follow through with calls to action. Promotions, e-mail marketing sign-up and employee profiles shouldn’t be all on the same page or area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Consider a layered approach. Put the most important info on your main pages, then take the more detailed, in-depth content deeper into your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are three deadly web design mistakes that small businesses make, but there are many more to be discussed. What other web design mistakes can you think of?</p>

Here are the other two blogs in case you need to catch up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="blog/bid/94765/3-Step-Guide-to-Inbound-Marketing-SEO-PPC-Social-Media">3-Step Guide to Inbound Marketing: SEO, PPC &amp; Social Media</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Adding a social media component is an important part to your overall marketing mix. In addition to the marketing value that social media sites have in of themselves, it is fact that social influence is a ranking factor for the search engines and will become more important going forward.  Sites like Facebook and Twitter have revolutionized mass communication, so it’s time your business joined the conversation.</p>
<p><em>Here are 5 ways to use </em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/business"><em>Facebook’s marketing tools</em></a><em>:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Pages – Creating a Facebook page is your opportunity to connect with and engage your potential customers.  Posting unique valuable content that engages your customers will help build your brand and a  loyal customer base.  Hint – Contests are a fantastic way to get your fans excited and involved.</li>
<li>Ads – With Facebook ads you can easily reach your target demographic by specific characteristics such as age, location, interests, and more. Hint – create a campaign with a message that speaks to the interests of women and a different campaign that speaks to men for higher conversion.</li>
<li>Sponsored Stories</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>Landing Pages</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Using Twitter for Business:</em></p>
<p>Twitter offers four different ways to advertise through promoted tweets, promoted trends, and promoted accounts. These are mainly for companies with big marketing budgets, not small businesses. If you’re advertising on Twitter with a minimum monthly budget of $5k – 10k, you’ve got access to their analytics tools. For the rest of us, we’re using a number of free and cost-effective tools to measure effectiveness on Twitter.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bit.ly.com/">Bit.ly</a> – a tool that allows users to shorten a long URL, share it and track the resulting usage. Use this tool to send people back to your website and measure which topics and types of tweets get the most attention.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite Pro</a> – a web-based online brand management tool that publishes to social sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Foursquare. You can set up bulk messages in advance and monitor your keywords by paying a few bucks for the PRO version.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://support.twitter.com/articles/49309-what-are-hashtags-symbols">HashTags</a> – Go back to your list of helpful keywords and hashtag them in your tweets. Be careful not to overdo the hashtags, because it can interfere with your message.</li>
</ol>
<p>FYI: <a href="blog/bid/91130/3-Twitter-Marketing-Mistakes-That-Lead-To-Lost-Twitter-Followers">3 Twitter Mistakes that Lead to Unfollows</a></p>
<p>A well-rounded inbound marketing mix is by far the most effective strategy when marketing any business.  Your customers find products and services differently, some through actively searching for a product or service on search engines, others through reviews and product recommendations on social media, and some of them might just remember that interesting blog post they read a few months back.  By using this multi-channeled approach you'll be sure your reaching all those customers and not leaving anyone out.</p>

<p>What’s great about Google is that the customer service reps are very helpful and will walk you through the process of signing up.</p>
<p>Adwords is for the more experienced Internet marketer, who wants more control over campaigns. Adwords allows you to pick your keywords, daily budget and how much you to pay per click.</p>

<p>Adwords Express is a nice place for novice Internet marketers to start off with pay-per-click ads. There are many benefits to Google Adwords Express, there’s one in particular that we’re especially excited to share as a main reason for not abandoning pay-per-click campaigns.</p>
<p>Adwords Express is the simplest way to get stated with Google Adwords search marketing.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #b70000;"><b>With Proximity Location, Ads Reaches Customers In Your Area</b></span></h3>
<p>Adwords Express uses proximity targeting to show your ad to people physically located near your business.  In Adwords Express, the default radius is 25 km and cannot be changed, but Adwords offers more freedom with this tool.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #b70000;"><b>Where AdWords Express Ads Are Placed</b></span></h3>
<p>Ads can appear in Google.com above or next to the search results or on Google Maps above the search results in the left hand panel. PPC ads do NOT appear in the organic search results, which are controlled by SEO, nor will they affect your ranking.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #b70000;"><b>How to Get Started</b></span></h3>
<p>First, you’ll need a mailing address. Even though a website isn’t required, it does seem like it would be a logical way to increase visitor lead conversion, doesn’t it? Websites aren’t mandatory, but are an integral part of a larger content marketing strategy that will increase your overall chances of moving up in search engine rankings.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #b70000;"><b>No Website? No Worries.</b></span></h3>
<p>If you don’t have the finances for a website right now, a Google Places page is your next best option. You’ll need to know how to create and optimize your Google Places page BEFORE you get started, so here’s a <a href="/google-places-optimization/" title="FREE webinar" target="_self"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FREE Google Places webinar</span></a>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #b70000;"><b>Internet Marketing – So Easy a Caveman Can Do It</b></span></h3>

<p>You don’t have to have a marketing degree to understand Internet marketing. What you must have is a great deal of time to keep up on the latest trends and test out what’s fact and what’s fluff. There is no overnight solution to Internet marketing, but if you’re looking for a small Internet marketing firm who is willing to walk through the finer points with you and help your business get more visibility online, <a href="/contact-us/" title="give us a ring" target="_self"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">give us a ring</span></a>.</p>

      <title>Local Businesses Benefit From Google SERP Upgrade</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Google’s decision to upgrade the look of local results on its SERPs is great news for local businesses (especially restaurants, landmarks, hotels, local businesses, museums, etc.) looking to give potential customers more details to help them make informed decisions. Instead of giving you a summary of the layout changes, we’ll walk you through what a customer will experience when searching Google for your business. <em>FYI: the new SERPs only shows up when searching for an individual business, not multiple locations.</em></p>
<p>For the sake of this blog, we’re using one of Atlanta’s favorite bakeries – Highland Bakery.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #b70000;"><b>New Detailed Places Content Shown On Right-Hand Panel </b></span></h3>
<p>When you Google [Highland Bakery] and hover over their places listing, you will notice a new panel on the right hand side. Before the upgrade, this panel featured only the Google Map. Now it’s way more robust and features the Google map with a marker for Highland Bakeries address along with two images featuring small pegmen<a href="http://maps.google.com/intl/en/help/maps/streetview/learn/pegman.html"></a> (the yellow-orange figure in the lower right hand corner of the images). He’s your guide to the Street View feature in Google Maps.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b><img id="img-1320787271340" src="/Portals/123780/images/Google%20Places%20SERP-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Google Places SERP resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Click on Pegman and you’ll be taken to the 360-degree interior view of Highland Bakery.  You’re instantly given a bird’s eye view into your business’s physical location, which can help with getting a feel of the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b><img id="img-1320787294566" src="/Portals/123780/images/Google%20Places%20Local%20SERP-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Google Places Local SERP resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wait, it gets better. The right side panel also provides further important details about the business below the images, these include a brief description, prices, hours, nearby public transportation routes, menus links and review links. These review sites include citysearch.com, urbanspoon.com, tripadvisor.com, and kudzu.com among others. Our guess is that these review sites will get a major bump in traffic as a result of Google's changes.  Yelp looks to be left out of the review sites listed in the Google places panel for the businesses we researched, most likely due to ongoing disputes between the two companies. </p>
<p>The big take away from this new update isn’t the update itself, but what it can do for your business. Potential customers can now quickly and easily find detailed information and opinions about your business and location. For this reason I believe we will see more and more companies spending the time or money it will take to make their <a href="/google-places-optimization/" title="Google Places listing" target="_self">Google Places listing</a> more appealing to its local audience.  </p>

      <title>How To Choose The Best Keywords For Search Engine Marketing Campaigns</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><em><img id="img-1320704070822" src="/Portals/123780/images/search%20engine%20marketing%20campaigns.jpg" border="0" alt="search engine marketing campaigns" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">For years, Google’s been keeping track of everything we search through their search engines. That’s right, everything you’ve ever searched is on file somewhere. Google has kept very detailed records that are proving useful for marketers and business owners alike. Learn to use this wealth of information to your advantage.<br></em></p>
<h2><span style="color: #c10000;">Here’s how: </span></h2>
<p>a)        Start by putting yourself in your customer’s shoes and jot down 10-20 search terms you would use to search the Internet for your business, industry and products. Google provides a free <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/faq/">keyword tool</a> to help you find relevant keyword ideas.</p>
<p>Now, before you go getting all excited about targeting keywords that have 50,000 searches a month, you should know that these so-called “popular” searches only make up about 30% of overall searches, according to SEOmoz. These keywords are also generally broad in nature and have much stiffer competition.  So what about the other 70% of searches?</p>
<p>The other 70% is comprised of what we in the business call “long tail” keyword phrases, which are made up of between 3 – 5 words in a phrase.  These “long tails” are typically much easier to rank for and usually much more specific.  Searchers googling these types of keywords are further along in their search and more likely to buy your product or service than those searching for the broad high competition keywords.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #c10000;">Tricks for finding "long tail" keywords:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Start typing your main keyword into Google search bar, Google's suggestion tool will start to list some of the "long tails" that other people have actually done real searches for.  Make note of these</li>
<li>Also type in your main keyword into Google and do a search, scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will get a list of "related searches" take note of these also they come from actual searches as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>b)        Take your keywords to Google Insights to compare search engine results and see the volume patterns across specific regions, categories, time frames and properties [<a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/94232/How-To-Use-Google-Insights-To-Market-Your-Business-Halloween-Edition" title="How can I use Google Insights for Search?" target="_self">How can I use Google Insights for Search?</a>].</p>
<p>c)        Now, that you’ve decided on the most frequently searched terms for your business or industry, weave them into your website tags and content to improve your website’s relevancy. </p>

      <title>3-Step Guide to Inbound Marketing: SEO, PPC &amp; Social Media</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1320351557074" src="/Portals/123780/images/guide%20to%20inbound%20marketing-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="guide to inbound marketing resized 600" width="424" height="258" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">With so much debate about the best way to increase website visits, many business owners may feel pressured to choose one specific strategy over another.</p>
<p>Instead of basing your business marketing strategy off the hottest new trend in the field, we suggest using this proven formula to drive traffic to your website.</p>
<h2 align="center"><span style="color: #a90000;"><b>SEO + PAY PER CLICK + SOCIAL MEDIA = INBOUND MARKETING</b></span></h2>
<p>The ultimate goal is to funnel Internet users to your website with this combination strategy approach of organic search engine optimization, pay per click and social media integration. Over the next three blog posts, we’ll go into detail about the finer points of <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="SEO" target="_self">SEO</a>, PPC and Social Media.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #a90000;"><b>1.    </b><b>[SEO] How Would You Search For Your Business or Industry?</b></span></h3>
<ol></ol>
<p>If your business name was your first thought, you’re off the mark. Think more along the lines of specific phrases that people associate with your industry. Your search terms should include nouns (the what) and locations (the where).</p>
<p>For example, if you’re searching for a Brazilian wax studio in Atlanta, your possible searches could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atlanta Brazilian wax,</li>
<li>Wax studio in Atlanta,</li>
<li>Atlanta wax studio,</li>
<li>Body wax in Atlanta, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #a90000;"><b>2.    </b><b>[PPC] Get Started With Google AdWords Today</b></span></h3>
<ol></ol>
<p>Some folks are still on the fence about Google Adwords and the success of <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/ppc-pay-per-click-internet-marketing" title="Pay-Per-Click" target="_self">Pay-Per-Click</a> as an Internet marketing strategy. To that, we say, the success of any marketing strategy is relative to other aspects of the campaign and PPC is no different.</p>
<p>Whereas SEO doesn’t offer instantaneous results and can sometimes take a few months to see real progress, a well-planned pay-per-click campaign can drive laser targeted traffic to your website within just a few hours. Paid search advertisements on Google are not only popular, but they’re proven to increase click-through rates.</p>
<p>Search engines pull in results differently for each type of result – organic and paid. In Google searches, both paid and organic results appear on the same page but are ranked by different factors. One search doesn’t impact another search, so It’s necessary to integrate SEO and PPC, because using only one won’t suffice.<b></b></p>
<h2><span style="color: #a90000;"><b>3.    </b><b>[Social Media] Get Social</b></span></h2>
<ol></ol>
<p>So, you’ve got your Facebook fan page and Twitter profile set-up, it’s branded, you’ve even got a following. Job well done, but it’s not over yet. Having a social media PRESENCE doesn’t mean you’ll see an instant ROI. There are multiple opportunities to integrate SEO and PPC with your <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing" title="social media strategy" target="_self">social media strategy</a>.</p>

      <title>How To Use Google Insights To Market Your Business: Halloween Edition</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Google Insights always offer free insight into what consumers are searching online in real-time. What better way to decide how to target consumers whether near or far.</p>
Since SearchDog Marketing is headquartered in Atlanta, let's analyze the data for our home town and show you some ways to use Google insights for marketing your business.
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/halloween%20google%20insights-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="halloween google insights resized 600" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Of the areas near Atlanta that are searching Halloween the most in the last 30 days, Rome is at the top of the list. Second is Cumming, third is Newnan and four is Canton. How can you use this info?</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a separate Google Adwords campaign for each city</li>
<li>Use geotargeting to only show ads in the appropriate city</li>
<li>Write ads that speak specifically to the customer in that city</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also gleen some information on what they are actually searching for from the list above you see that people are searching for costumes, party ideas, pumpkins, etc.  All great information to help you as a marketer create some type of interesting ad campaign or offer around. </p>
<p>The Halloween search is just an example, but I hope you can see the value in utilizing Google insights to find trends in online searches related to your product or service. </p>
<p>It would be wise for business owners to make good use of this FREE data provided by Google Insights. This information has strong implications for your online as well as offline marketing strategies. If you’re not keeping your thumb on what people are searching for, your business is potentially missing hundreds or thousands in profit or engagement opportunities (which are priceless).</p>

	<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/Social%20Media%20Contests-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Social Media Contests resized 600" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;">Halloween is the perfect time to <a href="/social-media-marketing-strategy-guide/" title="create a social media contest" target="_self">create a social media contest</a> to engage and reward your customers. You’ve heard all the hype about how social media contests and interactive promotions can generate more business for your company and fortunately research shows that it’s actually true.</p>
<p>In fact, a survey by Jupiter Research showed that 50% of Internet users enter sweepstakes at least once a month and 23 million Americans report that they enter contests or sweepstakes at least once a week. This is good news, no GREAT news, for business owners.</p>
<p>According to Google Insights, there’s a huge surge in web search interest related to Halloween 2011. The chart below displays the amount of interest over time in the last 30 days. Consumer interest in Halloween costumes, ideas and events is apparent and there is no reason why your business shouldn’t benefit from it. We’ve got just the application to help you design a creative Halloween social media contest, but keep in mind that this boost in searches probably happens around every holiday.</p>

      <title>3 Twitter Marketing Mistakes That Lead To Lost Twitter Followers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1319565219730" src="/Portals/123780/images/Twitter_marketing_mistakes-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Twitter marketing mistakes resized 600" width="369" height="277" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;">Twitter marketing is a tricky affair.  There are unspoken rules that need to be followed and respected if your company expects to have an impact in this medium.  Here are 3 twitter marketing mistakes your company should avoid if you want to hold on to your Twitter followers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #b30000;"><b>1.    </b><b>Spam-a-thon</b><b> </b></span></p>
<p>This is something that should go without saying, but many marketers and business people do not understand what constitutes spam in the eyes of consumers. In the world of Twitter, spam can come in many forms, but here are the most committed Twitter spam sins I’ve witnessed in recent weeks.</p>
<p><b>Automated Direct Messages</b> (DM’s) are perceived by many consumers in the social media marketplace as indicative of spam. Yes, Twitter provides this feature as a part of their service. No, you do not have to use this feature just because it’s available. If someone decided to follow you, they did so because they are interested in what you have to say. There’s no need to send an impersonal or personal (creepy) automated DM thanking them for following you or leading them to your website.</p>
<p>Because Twitter allows you to follow only those you want to see in your timeline on a daily basis, there’s an extra ‘personal’ element associated with this site. People take it personally when they’re subjected to direct spamming. A better approach to welcome new followers is to ‘mention’ them directly in a group of one or more.</p>
<p>Ex: @searchdogmarket welcomes our newest followers - @thelady44, @socialkarma156, and @starbucksjunkie. Be on the lookout for Twitter exclusives!</p>
<span style="color: #b30000;"><b>2.    </b><b>The Over Hashtagger</b><b> </b></span>
<p>There’s nothing more annoying than seeing this:</p>
<p>Ex. @searchdogmktg #follow #us #for #free #marketing #advice #TODAY!</p>
<p>Over hashtagging directly results in unfollows and a poor image in the eyes of your followers. Not only is this considered spam, it also shows an ignorance of Twitter etiquette that is a definite turn-off for your followership. Every word or the majority of words in your tweet should not be hashtagged. Here’s a great <a href="http://business.twitter.com/">Twitter guide</a> for business owners. Use hashtags to promote keywords related to promotions, contests, or hot-button topics.</p>
<span style="color: #b30000;"><b>3.    </b><b>A Two-Way Street</b></span>
<p>Twitter should be a part of your company’s larger efforts to engage in two-way communication with your target market. Therefore, if a consumer makes a comment, negative or positive, about your company, products, or industry, you’re required to respond in some fashion. Too many businesses are guilty of creating social media websites and only conducting one-way communication, which is completely self-serving. Instead focus your efforts on a two-way approach that responds to consumer inquiry in a timely and appropriate fashion. Tweetdeck, a free, 3<sup>rd</sup> party monitoring and scheduling web based application, can create search panels to monitor mentions of your business, brand, and topics and topics related to your industry.</p>
<p>Who.Unfollowed.Me is another web-based tool that allows you to see exactly which of your followers unfollowed you. This is valuable information that can make all the difference in your company’s Twitter strategy. Use this information to see what tweets caused followers to leave your fold.</p>

<p>Are you making the most of the power of blogging for driving traffic to your site, educating, informing and entertaining your visitors, and establishing your company’s internet presence?</p>
<p><b>A Blog – By Any Other Name it Would Still be as Tweet</b></p>
<p>First, let’s look at the anatomy of a blog. Web logs, or ‘blogs’, are generally maintained on a regular basis with entries of comments, information, events, videos, or podcasts. Tweets, posted via Twitter, are actually microblogs; kissin’ cousins with texts.</p>
<p>To ensure you’re maximizing your blog’s reach, it must be interactive. This means visitors can leave comments, message one another via widgets, and reach related blogs, websites, and other media via links.</p>
<p><b>10 Blogging Tips For Your Business</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Less Tends to be More.</b> Get to the point with main ideas right away. This allows the reader to decide within seconds if he or she wants to read the entire post. Assume your reader is going to skim; after all, isn’t that what you’re doing right now? </li>
<li>
<b>Always write with your audience in mind.</b> That means if you’re writing to a global audience, don’t use sophisticated words that only a certain population will understand. On the other hand, perhaps your <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/blog/bid/74444/3-Ways-Creating-A-Corporate-Blog-Will-Bring-You-More-Business" title="corporate blog" target="_self">corporate blog</a> is only for patent attorneys. In this case, using more industry specific terminology is appropriate.</li>
<li>
<b>Writer, edit thyself.</b> Ernest Hemingway was definitely onto something. Write, then edit. Keep it short. Keep it focused. Your readers will love you for it. Enough said.</li>
<li>
<b>Headlines, Headlines, Headlines.</b> Create punchy, specific headlines that summarize your post. In effect, you are creating ‘micro’ content that can actually stand alone – and that gives you bang for your buck. These headlines may be viewed via a news portal, a search engine result, an RSS feed, a bookmark, an archive of your blog, or other means. Therefore, it is likely to be keeping company with scores of other headlines – make them stand out.</li>
<li>
<b>Link up, and down</b>. Make sure you include a good number of links to other web pages that support your post, but be choosy. However, too many links, too close together, may actually serve to steal your thunder, so to speak.</li>
<li>
<b>Eye Candy.</b> Make your posts pop by using a variety of colorful, pertinent pictures, images, and links.</li>
<li>
<b>Steak and Sizzle.</b> It’s all about readability. The steak is the content. The sizzle is the ‘bling’, if you will, and that includes bullet points, lists, white space, images, tables, sub-headlines, examples, indented notes, indented quotes, icons, colors, bold and italics – all make it easier for your readers to scan your post. Get creative!</li>
<li>
<b>Mix it up.</b> Vary your posts, as far as some being more narrative, and others being more list oriented.</li>
<li>
<b>Regular updates.</b> The blogosphere is changing by the nanosecond. Make blogging on a regular basis a habit to keep your readers, and your presence, current.</li>
<li>
<b>Back to Basics. </b>Spellcheck, grammar, edit, formatting; you’re putting a little bit of yourself out there in the blogosphere. Make a good impression. Be professional. Remember your manners. Credit sources. Correct your blog if need be. Mark updates and changes.</li>

      <title>6 Ways the IPhone 4s Release Can Improve Your Marketing</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<h2><b><span style="color: #cc0000;"><img id="img-1319047902857" src="/Portals/123780/images/iphone%204s%20release-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Iphone 4s release" width="446" height="297" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">iPhone 4S Released October 14, 2011</span><br></b></h2>
<p>Apple’s iPhone 4S, available for sale in recent days in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the U.K., surpassed projected sales of an astounding 4 million units this past weekend. As reported per businessweek.com, the iPhone has become Apple’s top moneymaker, and accounts for almost half of its total revenue.</p>
<p>Driving the sales for many that lined up for hours before stores opened, in all kinds of weather, was their admiration of the late Steve Jobs. When I asked my friend, who anxiously awaited the UPS man’s arrival to her house what motivated her purchase, she stated simply, “I loved Steve Jobs.”</p>
<p>Most assuredly, Jobs’ death is causing sales to skyrocket, as buyers turn shopping lines into memorials of sorts; somehow, owning a new iPhone pays tribute in a way most befitting a man whose entire life centered on the conception and delivery of cool gadgetry. A man who, as he put succinctly upon the iPhone’s initial unveiling in 2007: “Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.” And so they did.</p>
<p>And they continue to do so.</p>
<p>Billed as “Picking up where amazing left off,” the fifth generation iPhone features a dual-core A5 chip, which delivers greater power, an 8MP camera with brand new optics, which also shoots 1080p HD video, and Siri, an intelligent, voice activated assistant to do your bidding.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>Focus Your Marketing Efforts on the iPhone 4S Features</b></span></h2>
<p>So, aside from having an iconoclastic leader, and an amazing product, what can the rest of us mere mortals learn from this epic product launch, and perhaps humbly apply to our own businesses? Incorporate the features of iPhone 4S into exciting new opportunities and methods for marketing. How?</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>If you don’t already have a mobile-optimized, or smart-phone optimized, website, now is the time to do it. If you’re a retailer, this should be your number one priority, especially with the holidays fast approaching. Consumers live and die by the Smartphone these days; socializing, shopping and surfing.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Apps rule. While apps are more expensive when it comes to development and promotion, they’re convenient, and facilitate, repeat business.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now is the time for mobile advertising. Increase your awareness and use of mobile advertising, to promote your mobile site, apps, bricks and mortar stores, or whatever makes the most sense for your business, but budget for it. It’s no longer ‘nice to have’, it’s ‘must have’.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Share, and share alike. The 4S has a camera to rival most models. In addition, the 4S offers built-in Twitter functions, as well as the new Find My Friends feature. Add in the rumors that Facebook may soon be offering mobile-related updates, and it all adds up to one thing – marketers need to take full advantage of the Smartphone in promoting their businesses and brands.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Is the experience that your company is offering as seamless as technology has enabled it to be? In other words, think outside the box, or in this case, the device – technology has made it extremely easy for consumers to begin an experience on one device, and finish it on another. Examples include using your phone to play a game on the television, or transferring photos between iPhones and iPads. Not only is the technology seamless, so is your customer base, along with their preferences – are you catering to this need?</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>The 4S hails Siri, its voice recognition technology, as part of the new experience for its customers. How can you be proactive in using this capability to facilitate your company’s experience for your customer? 4S users can perform such tasks as searching for nearby restaurants and checking flight times. Though it’s not front and center yet, this capability could be the up and coming trend to watch. What marketing opportunities exist for you?</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, these are only some suggestions about how you can coordinate your company’s marketing efforts with the iPhone 4S features. Certain methods will work better, and make more sense, than others for you and your business. The primary focus should be the connectivity the Smartphone enables, and ensuring this drives all marketing decisions and efforts.</p>

      <title>5 Tips On Making The Most Out of Twitter Marketing For Your Business</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1319232466167" src="/Portals/123780/images/Twitter%20marketing.jpg" border="0" alt="Twitter marketing" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">Whether you’re new to Twitter marketing or you tweet regularly, chances are the opportunity exists for you to more effectively use this powerful social media tool to market your business.</p>
<p>The beauty of Twitter is that, by its very nature, it’s all about brevity – just like the text messages we send and receive every day. Not surprisingly, Twitter was fashioned in the likeness of the almighty SMS.</p>
<p>The power of Twitter marketing lies in the ability to follow, and be followed. Essentially, when you follow someone, it means their tweets appear in your ‘tweetstream’, or the update feed of real time posts. Additionally, following is not mutual, meaning just because you’re following someone, doesn’t mean they’ll follow you.</p>
<p>These microblogs of up to 140 characters, more popularly known as “tweets”, can pack a wallop as part of a well-planned marketing strategy, and they are a low cost alternative to other forms of advertising. So, how do you make the most of it?</p>
<h2>
<span style="color: #e00000;"><b>Create A Twitter Marketing Plan For Your Business</b>   </span>       </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Become an expert spectator.</strong>  For the first 30 – 60 days don’t do anything but observe.  Find the leaders and influencers in your market using wefollow.com and learn how they interact with customers.   Take note of the keyword phrases people use when talking about your product or service, so that you can monitor those words. Watch for any trends that you can uncover.</li>
<li>
<strong>Strategize and create your message.</strong>  If you’ve done the first step right, then you know who your target audience is and how the interact on Twitter.  Now use that information to craft an interesting and relevant message.  Give your company a personality.  This is a great time to include other types of media like video, podcasting, photos, etc.  Stealing an idea from a client of ours, how bout creating a behind the scenes video “A day in the life of a …” and follow you around for a day in your business (Obviously you’ll probably need to use some killer editing and creative use of music if your days are as lame as some of mine.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Build your targeted Twitter audience.</strong>  In the first step we talked about keeping notes on the keyword phrases people use when talking about your product or service, well now we’re going to use them.  Use Twitter’s keyword search tool and plugin the keyword phrases you found.  This should bring back a list of targeted Twitterers that will be receptive to your message.  Follow them, there’s a good chance they’ll follow you back.</li>
<li>
<strong>Organize and automate your Twitter marketing.</strong>  Create an editorial calendar, a simple excel spreadsheet that maps out your tweet posts.  You need to specify when to post, what type of content (link to blog post, video, pictures, etc.), content topic (educational content, testimonial, shout out to a client, webinar promotion, etc.), and how many tweets per day.  We all have multiple tasks in our business’ by creating this editorial calendar you can schedule your posts and use an automation tool to do the posting for you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Monitor chatter about your company.</strong> Using Twitter’s search engine, you can see who is talking about your company.  Create an RSS feed for these searches or use a twitter monitoring tool to stay constantly updated on whos talking about you and what they’re saying.  This gives you the perfect opportunity to connect. After all Twitter is SOCIAL media.  And if they say something nice, retweet, connect with the person, and incentivize them to continue to promote your brand.</li>
</ol>
<ol></ol>
<p>Now get out there and just do it.  The more you get involved the more comfortable you will become.  Twitter marketing provides businesses a powerful tool for networking, and exponential opportunities for communication. Have you tweeted today?</p>

      <title>The Life and Death of Steve Jobs and The Future Of Apple</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>By Rebecca E. Neely</p>
<p><img id="img-1317997472323" src="/Portals/123780/images/Steve-Jobs-Death--resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Steve Jobs Death" width="434" height="290" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">“It’s not the consumer’s job to know what they want.”</p>
<p>A helluva quote from a helluva man. And that, I believe, just about says it all. It captures the very heart of what Steve Jobs was all about, beyond gadgets, beyond technology, beyond invention, beyond innovation, he was about putting possibilities in the palms of our hands.</p>
<p>The words capture the essence of a man whose visionary genius changed not only history, but the future, as well as the boundaries of business, markets, and industries, from music to cell phones to tablets to advertising.</p>
<p>The indelible mark he’s made, and the knowledge that he’s transcended generations, is evident to me as I type these words. I’m listening to iTunes in the background on my laptop. iPad is part of the suggested words when I do a Spellcheck. Today, when my almost ten-year-old daughter comes home from school, she’ll show me a cool new game she’s downloaded on her iPod. His name, and his work, were a part of my Management Information Systems classes in college. And when I typed my first resume, I did it on a Mac.</p>
<p>How strange – or not, considering life seems to be in the business of strange – that this man, who touched my life, and the lives of so many others, should share the scourge of pancreatic cancer with my father, who passed just a few short years ago, and who I also consider a helluva man – all in his own class, by the way.</p>
<p>Here’s looking at you. And you.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d60000;">Apple's Future Unclear After Steve Jobs Death</span></h2>
<p>The question now becomes, without <strong>Steve Jobs</strong> in place in the iconic domain – no pun intended – he’s created, what’s next for Apple?</p>
<p>Of course, one of the most pressing issues on everyone’s minds is successor CEO Tim Cook, and whether he can deliver, on all fronts, especially given the recent less than wow iPhone 4S event, by many accounts. According to the October 7th usatoday.com article, “What's next for Apple?” Gartner analyst Van Baker was quoted as saying: “Tim's not Steve. He's much more low-key. He's much more laid-back.”</p>
<p>Indeed. Tim is not Steve. And perhaps, better than anyone, Jobs realized the inherent value of individuality, and undoubtedly, given his talent and tenacity, selected Cook to run the show for more than just his impressive resume. Enough said.</p>
<p>Along with his vision for change, Jobs clearly recognized the value of preservation, as is evident in another of his many endeavors. Perhaps the very essence – heart, and soul, and mind – of this great man will have the opportunity to live on in an unconventional way, as well suits Jobs, by manner of Apple University: an executive training program that’s been under wraps for some time now.</p>
<p>According to the October 6th latimes.com article, “Steve Jobs’ virtual DNA to be fostered in Apple University”, a former Apple executive who requested anonymity was quoted as saying: “Steve was looking to his legacy. The idea was to take what is unique about Apple and create a forum that can impart that DNA to future generations of Apple employees. No other company has a university charged with probing so deeply into the roots of what makes the company so successful.”</p>
<p>Though Apple didn’t comment on the project, those familiar with it say Joel Podolny, himself a legendary genius by many accounts, and the former dean of Yale’s Business School, was personally recruited by Jobs to run it. According to the latimes.com article, longtime Apple analyst Tim Bajarin was quoted as saying: “It became pretty clear that Apple needed a set of educational materials so that Apple employees could learn to think and make decisions as if they were Steve Jobs.”</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d60000;">Apple University - Another Steve Jobs Innovation<br></span></h2>
<p>Using Pixar as a model, the animation studio Jobs sold to Disney for $7.5 billion in 2006, Jobs crafted Apple University, which builds on Pixar University. The professional development program offers courses in such subjects as fine arts and filmmaking, and leadership and management, to immerse employees in the company’s culture, history and values, along with its craft.</p>
<p>Apple University embraces the values Jobs brought to life, and lived – accountability, attention to detail, perfectionism, simplicity, secrecy. The courses that embody these values were guided by Jobs himself, translating principles into workable, intelligent strategies and business practices – also meant to be lived.</p>
<p>Perhaps greater than any type of technology, gadget or invention, is the intangible that Apple University is meant to impart, a most precious resource Jobs clearly hopes to pass on to future  generations. That, I believe, is perhaps the ultimate gift – one that will keep on giving, long after our iPads’, and our, batteries run low.</p>
<p>Here’s to possibilities and to much more than just “one more thing”, to quote you, if I may, Mr. Jobs.</p>

      <title>How to use LinkedIn Groups to Fill Your Sales Funnel</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><strong><img id="img-1317995026618" src="/Portals/123780/images/LinkedIN%20Groups.jpg" border="0" alt="LinkedIN Groups" width="289" height="225" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">LinkedIn Groups</strong> is a powerful social media platform, enabling professionals to network on a grand scale. With over 120 million members and growing, it’s not only a resource for cultivating knowledge and ideas, but opportunities – namely, for companies to fill their sales funnels.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #c50000;">What Is A Sales Funnel?</span></h2>
<p>The concept of a sales funnel is a systematic and powerful approach to selling. Envision a funnel. The widest part is at the top –  these are the opportunities, or the leads. The funnel becomes progressively narrower, and at the bottom, or the opening, is quite aptly, the sale itself. Between the top and bottom various forms of communications, negotiations and evaluations take place. And, a s is well known, the number of leads is often much greater than the number of sales actually closed.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #c50000;">Strategies For Using LinkedIn Groups To Fill Your Sales Funnel</span></h2>
<p>Following are some suggestions for applying the ‘sales funnel’ approach to <strong>using LinkedIn Groups</strong> to obtain prospects, and convert them into sales.</p>
<p>Begin by typing the name of the person you want to connect with in the search box in the upper right hand corner of your LinkedIn profile. In addition, you’ll also want to make sure you’re taking full advantage of “People You May Know” tab; these are professionals LinkedIn suggests for you, based on the connections you currently have with other professionals. As well, take full advantage of the “Groups You May Like” LinkedIn suggests, based on your field, interests and expertise.</p>
<p>After you find the prospect’s profile, click on his or her name to view it, and groups to which they belong.</p>
<p>First, look for any groups you have in common. Because LinkedIn doesn’t permit you to make ‘cold’ connections, being able to connect via a shared group is ideal. However, if you and the prospect do not have any groups in common, you can still: join one of the groups to which your prospect belongs, and/or connect with a prospect by asking him or her to connect with you as a fellow member of a particular group. In fact, the chances of the prospect accepting your invitation are greater, as the shared membership fosters trust.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #c50000;">Actively Engage In LinkedIn Groups. Become An Authority.<br></span></h2>
<p>Once you’ve done this, become active in the group by starting and engaging in discussions, submitting news items and posting helpful content. This will demonstrate your expertise, as the discussions in which you participate appear on the other group members' home pages. In this manner, you will be included in the daily digest of emails <strong>LinkedIn groups</strong> generates to members. It’s similar to receiving a free email blast. If your content is relevant and useful, you’ll generate interest, and as a result, leads. This step is critical, as you will appear in your prospect’s inbox daily via email. At this point, you’re cultivating the relationship, and you want them to get to know you. And unless your prospect unsubscribes, this is a golden opportunity to do just that.</p>
<p>Getting this process underway can be time consuming, but is well worth the time. Consistency, and persistence, as always, pay off. Commit to spending one to three weeks generating leads in this manner, or more. At times, you may even find prospects will contact you.</p>
<p>Approaching lead generation, and increasing sales with the ‘sales funnel’ concept in mind is systematic, and incorporates ‘best practice’ concepts from other disciplines, allowing you to quantify the process, and break it down into manageable steps. Applying the concept to LinkedIn Groups for lead generation allows you to take advantage of all the social media platform has to offer, which is undeniably an exponential resource.</p>

      <title>Google Adwords Express: Local Marketing So Easy A Caveman Could Do It</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1317163601208" src="/Portals/123780/images/Google%20adwords%20express.jpg" border="0" alt="Google adwords express" width="368" height="185" class="alignRight" style="float: right;">The marketing platform once known as "Google Boost" has undergone a significant facelift over the past year to become what is now known as "Google Adwords Express." </p>
<p>Have you ever tried to create an Adwords campaign for your business only to become frustrated and overwhelmed with the process and work involved?  Well not anymore, with "Adwords Express," the search engine giant is hoping to attract novice marketers to they're pay per click advertising model by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortening the learning curve</li>
<li>Eliminating the hassle of keyword research and campaign setup</li>
<li>Making targeting the right audience extremely simple</li>
<li>Removing the need for campaign management</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #b71522;">Is Google Adwords Express Really That Simple?</span></h2>
<p>The main goal of "Adwords Express" is to help local businesses quickly deploy targeted online marketing campaigns without having to be an Adwords expert. </p>
<p>Setting up these campaigns can be done in a few simple steps, just enter the category your business falls into, pick a monthly budget from the choices provided, create an interesting ad that appeals to potential customers, and provide a page where you want to send the traffic (either a page on your website or a Google Places page). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img id="img-1317163423017" src="/Portals/123780/images/set-up-adwords-express-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Google Adwords Express" width="475" height="305" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Once you've completed this information and hit save, Google Adwords express automatically creates a fully functional adwords campaign with recommended keywords and bid amounts. </p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In less than an hour your ad can be in front of all those potential customers in your local area searching for your product or service.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #b71522;">Adwords Express sounds great, what do I need to get started?</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">First off, a mailing address is mandatory.  And although you don't have to have a website, it will more than likely increase your visitor to lead conversion rate.  If you don't currently have a website, give us a call we can help you out.</span></p>
<p>If you don't have a website and don't want to spend money on one at the moment, your Google places page will suffice.  We've got a great FREE webinar showing you <a href="/google-places-optimization/" title="how to create and optimize your Google Places page" target="_self">how to create and optimize your Google Places page</a>, so check it out!</p>
<p>You don't need any expertise or experience with online advertising whatsoever. All that's left is for you to determine what your monthly budget will be, and you get an estimate of how many clicks you can expect to receive based on that budget.  All the heavy lifting of campaign creation is done for you.  Now just sit back and let the traffic roll in.</p>
<p>For any local business owner looking to generate leads from the search engines, but isn't ready to pay a professional this is a fantastic starting point.  My only suggestion would be to send your visitors to a website that's set up to convert that traffic.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a more robust search advertising campaign to help you reach even more potential clients or just want a new website to help you grow your business, <a href="/contact-us/" title="give us a ring." target="_self">give us a ring.</a></p>

      <title>New Facebook Features Unveiled at The F8 Developers Conference</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1316721563134" src="/Portals/123780/images/F8%20Developers%20Conference%202011.jpg" border="0" alt="F8 Developers Conference 2011" width="510" height="340" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Today Mark Zuckerberg and his team at <a href="http://facebook.com/searchdogmarketing" title="Facebook" target="_self">Facebook</a> held there annual <b>F8 Developers Conference 2011</b>.  In his keynote address Zuckerbert unveiled some pretty interesting new features that will be launching in beta today and rolled out over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Two of the big features Facebook will be revealing directly after the <b>F8 Developers Conference</b> will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Graph – “A new class of social apps to help you discover new things with your friends”</li>
<li>Timeline – “all your photos, all your apps, and a new way to express who you are”</li>
</ul>
<p>Open graph was first revealed at the F8 Conference 2 years ago, and each year it evolves.  The mission is for open graph to create a more social experience for Facebook users.  The Open Graph’s new class of social apps include media apps (music, movies, tv, books, etc.), lifestyle apps (exercise, food, fashion, etc.), and gaming apps. </p>
<p>With these apps you will now be able to let your friends know when you “Listen” to a song, “Watch” a TV show, “Read” a book, and your friends can “Listen,” ”Watch,” ”Read”, etc. along with you in real time.</p>
<p>The <b>Facebook Open Graph</b> sets out to help you discover new things with your friends through 3 main ideas.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frictionless experiences</span> – if you’ve logged into your Facebook account today, you may have noticed a change in your news feed.  Now the news feed only shows top stories, which I will get to in a second, and status updates.  All other activities - liking pages, friending people, attending events, etc. will be shown realtime in a light weight scrolling feed in the upper right hand corner called the “Ticker.”  This update is an attempt to make news feeds less noisy and only show what Facebook deems important, but there will definitely be “haters”.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Realtime serendipity</span> – In the ticker you can see what your friends are doing real time.  Say your friend is “Listening” to “Empire State of Mind” and you see it in your ticker.  Well you can now click on that feed and listen right along with them in real time.  Pretty cool, huh?  You can also do this with TV shows, Movies, Books, and News right now.  Companies like Spotify (Music), Hulu (TV), Netflix (Movies), and Yahoo News (News) already have apps available for use.</li>
<li>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finding Patterns in Activity</span> – Ok so remember when I began to talk about top stories.  Well when several of your friends are doing the same activity, for example, five of your friends are now “Listening to “Empire State of Mind” then it is seen as a pattern and will now go from your ticker to your news feed as a Top Story.  Just another way to help you find new music, movies, news stories, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The photo rich Timeline gives sharing your life story with your friends a whole new meaning.  Timeline integrates with all of the new social apps so that you can express who you are even further. </p>
<p>During his <b>F8 Conference Keynote</b>, Zuckerberg showed a lifestyle app called “Social Cooking” where you can share meals you have recently cooked.  There’s another lifestyle app that shows your running routes and distances and sends you a report.  And all these apps and activities are saved on your Timeline so your online friends can really understand your personality.</p>
<p>All in all I think the features revealed in the <b>F8 2011 Conference</b> are a good thing.  I’ve heard a lot of people complain about the updated news feed, but personally I like the fact that I can filter out all the noise and only see the things I care about.  I think Facebook is changing the game, now will Google + step up or be left behind? Let me know what you think.  Please leave your comments below.</p>

      <title>3 Ways Creating A Corporate Blog Will Bring You More Business</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1316542721273" src="/Portals/123780/images/Creating%20a%20Corporate%20Blog-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="Creating a Corporate Blog" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br><br></p>
<p>In today's fast paced marketplace, people want to find the information they're looking for quickly and efficiently. When you <a href="/blog-setup-and-services/" title="create a corporate blog" target="_self">create a corporate blog</a> and utilize it correctly, you dramatically improve the chances of placing your company in front of these information seekers in your industry.  </p>
<p>By creating an educational and forward thinking corporate blog, you're giving your potential customers a hub of information and valuable content without trying to hard sell them.  And as a result many of them will thank you by becoming loyal readers and eventually <a href="/how-to-get-more-customers/" title="paying customers for your business" target="_self">paying customers for your business</a>.</p>
<p>While there are many ways <a href="/blog-setup-and-services/" title="building a corporate business blog" target="_self">building a corporate business blog</a> can help bring you more business, there are 3 that should convince you to start today.</p>
<ol>
<li>Authoritative Positioning - By creating a corporate blog, you are able to position yourself as an authority in you industry.  Posts should be a mixture of educational (how to's, tips, etc.), thought leadership (creating new ideas and conversations), news, and entertainment (videos, industry comics, etc.) </li>
<li>Search Engine Visibility - Google and other search engines thrive on new, unique, and useful content.  For this reason Google loves large sites with lots of content, so by creating a corporate blog and posting to it consistently you are doing two fold to increase your search engine visibility.</li>
<ol>
<li>First, everytime you create a new blog post, you are adding a new page of content to your website and therefore increasing the size of your website.  The easier it is for your site to rank for keyword phrases.</li>
<li>Second, when you create corporate blog posts you should be using what we call longtail keywords (keyword phrases of over three words that are very specific) in your blog post titles and sprinkled throughout the content of the post.  Longtail keywords are generally easier to rank for and the people searching for those phrases are usually closer to buying.</li>
</ol>
<li>Social Reach - Social media as a marketing channel is a relatively new concept, but there is no doubt that it has created huge value for both B2B and B2C companies, and it's not going anywhere anytime soon.  A corporate blog in itself is a social media tool.  Couple that with the fact that you can integrate your blog with social powerhouses like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter and you've created an extremely strong social piece to your marketing arsenal.  Deliver your message to your networks efficiently and watch it grow virally.</li>
</ol>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;">So there it is folks, 3 ways to reach more people, build credibility, and <a href="/how-to-get-more-customers/" title="generate loyal customers for your brand" target="_self">generate loyal customers for your brand</a> by creating a corporate blog.  A corporate blog is a powerful tool and it's only going to become more vital as Google and the other search engines alter there algorithms to become a more social search engine where valuable content and social factors are king.</span></span></div>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Who are their current clients?</strong> Obviously, any online advertising agency will have a website that should provide you with a wealth of information. Carefully look over their client list and see if it includes companies you are familiar with, respect, or do business with yourself. While both small businesses and large corporations are important, those large corporate clients only work with the best because they have a well-established brand to protect.</li>
<li>
<strong>How do they rank in their field?</strong> Every industry has its set of accolades, business associations, and rankings. <strong>SEO management</strong> firms are no different. If they have been recognized recently as a top or growing firm, chances are you are in good hands. A lack of awards or recognition does not necessarily indicate a lack of ability, but it does mean the firm has yet to demonstrate its effectiveness in a relatively new field. Entrusting your web presence to a company with a proven track record is simply the smart thing to do.</li>
<li>
<strong>How well do they market themselves?</strong> As you navigate through their website, take notice of how they present themselves to potential clients. If there are case studies, testimonials, and press releases posted, first of all, read them. Secondly, recognize that it is a good sign because not only are their clients happy to recommend them publically, but also the firm can concretely illustrate the impact they have had on those clients.</li>
<li>
<strong>How are they perceived by others?</strong> Now that you have thoroughly vetted their website, Google them. Check out each link, particularly ones from third party, professional organizations. If you are reading individual consumer reviews, note when it was submitted and give more weight to more recent submissions. A business can evolve a lot in a few years. Also, consider both the positive and negative reviews, keeping in mind that people are more likely to post about a negative experience than a positive one. If you see something that concerns you, make a note of it and ask the firm about the circumstances. How they respond will tell you a lot about what they are like to work with and how much merit the complaint or negative opinion may have.</li>
<li>
<strong>What are your impressions after your initial meeting?</strong> Once you have done your due diligence and narrowed down your options to no more than three firms, make appointments with each one for a consultation. If possible, in person is best. While it is true much of your interaction will be via email or over the phone, nothing can replace the value of a face-to-face meeting. Beforehand, prepare your questions and make sure you understand the basic terms and practices so you can have a productive and intelligent conversation before making such an important decision.  </li>
</ol>
<p>This is an important investment and can be a pivotal moment for your company. Once you have done your research and met, if you like what you have learned and what they have proposed, you have probably found the <a href="http://www.wpromote.com/seo" target="_blank">SEO management</a> team for you. Having considered these five things, you can make your decision with confidence and look forward to watching your web presence grow along with your business.</p>

      <title>Tips For Using Foursquare Marketing For Businesses Without A Location</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><a href="http://www.searchdogmarketing.com/social-media-marketing.html"><img src="/Portals/123780/images/foursquare.jpg" border="0" alt="foursquare" title="Foursquare Marketing" width="417" height="296" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></a></p>
<p>In the past couple of years, there has been a huge surge in using social media sights to market local or national businesses.  Sites like Facebook and Twitter are the most obvious, but have you heard about <a href="/social-media-marketing/">Foursquare Marketing</a>?  Foursquare is primarily for letting your friends know where you are and figuring out where they are. Secondarily, it’s for collecting points, prize “badges,” and eventually, coupons, for going about your everyday business.  And it is becoming extremely popular.</p>
<p>As the popularity has grown so has the interest by various businesses to use it as a marketing tool.  Since Foursquare is a location based social networking site, it has become a very powerful tool for marketing local businesses that have an actual storefront or location.  But what about those businesses without an an actual location.  Can these businesses use <strong>Foursquare marketing</strong> as another marketing strategy?  Scott Bishop tackles this question in a great blog post over on Mashable.com.  Here’s what he has to say.</p>
<p>“The marketing opportunities for retail stores on Foursquare are obvious. Users physically check in to a location and if you offer a special, they can redeem it. But even without a special, Foursquare leads to foot traffic, and foot traffic leads to revenue. Pretty straightforward.”</p>
<p>“But what if you’re aren’t a retail store? What if you don’t have a physical location at all? Can Foursquare still help you market your business? Absolutely. Foursquare has already partnered with several large brands without traditional locations such as Bravo and the <a href="http://foursquare.com/historychannel" target="_blank">History Channel</a>. These partnerships were heavily publicized and came with specially customized badges, but they also cost big bucks.”</p>

      <title>How To Get More Customers Using Article Marketing</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><a href="/"><img id="img-1320705998968" src="/Portals/123780/images/article-marketing.jpg" border="0" alt="Atlanta Article Marketing Company" title="Atlanta Article Marketing" width="300" height="299" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></a></p>
<p>One of the most popular <a href="/how-to-get-more-customers/" title="ways to get more customers" target="_self">ways to get more customers</a> using SEO is <a href="/">article marketing for your business</a> or article distribution. Article marketing has become a fan favorite for several reasons.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons building links through<a href="/"> article distribution for your business</a> is so popular is the ability to use anchor text. When you submit to an article directory, there is a special section for your author bio where you are allowed to include anchor text links pointing back to your websites. This gives you a chance to tell the Google spiders exactly what your site is about using clickable keywords. We generally add two anchor text links in our author bios and possibly one in the body of the article if allowed.</p>
<p>Another big reason article marketing is so awesome at <a href="/how-to-get-more-customers/" title="getting more customers" target="_self">getting more customers</a> is because one piece of content has the ability to become thousands of backlinks for your website. If you write quality interesting content it has the possibility of being picked up by people looking for content for their sites. Syndication remains one of the best ways to get links for your sites, so always write quality content.</p>
<p>Once you write an article there are a ton of directories you can submit it to. Some are better than others. As a rule always submit to <a href="http://www.ezinearticles.com" target="_blank">Ezine Articles</a> first, because they have the strictest publishing rules. Here is a list of some of our favorite article directories.</p>
<ol>
<li>

      <title>How To Get Your Business On Google First Page Using Blog Commenting</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><img id="img-1320706094946" src="/Portals/123780/images/seo-blog.png" alt="How to get your business on Google" title="Blog Commenting SEO" width="441" height="249"></p>
<p>If you have your own business you might be wondering “How Do you get your business on Google?”.  Well, If you’ve been following our <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="Atlanta SEO" target="_self">Atlanta SEO</a> guide series we’ve given you quite a few weapons for your  SEO and link building strategies, and its time to add another tool to your belt with blog comments SEO.   Again <strong>blog commenting for SEO</strong> can be an extremely powerful way to get highly relevant backlinks for your business websites, and as an added bonus you get to use anchor text.</p>
<p>Using our Big List of  Google “footprints” post, use the specific search engine “footprints” for locating “do follow” blogs in your niche.  The “do follow” is important because some websites attach a “no follow” tag to all outgoing links, which tells search engine spiders basically not to give your site credit for the link.  We do believe “no follow” links help, but not as much as “do follow’ links.  So remember to use the search operator ” do follow” in your searches.</p>
<p>Now type your query into Google, hit enter, and presto, you’ve got a list of linking partners that are tightly related to your niche.  Now its time to post blog comments for SEO.  Just find an interesting post on the site, read the post, and write a quality comment related to the post.</p>
<p>To get an anchor text link to your site, enter your target keyword as your name and enter your url in the space provided with http:// before the url.  This makes your keyword a clickable link pointing back to your site telling the search engine spiders exactly what your site is about.</p>
<p>We use blog comments SEO frequently to get top search engine rankings for our clients and hope this answers your question “How do I get <strong>my website on google</strong>?” and get those all powerful 1st page rankings for your business as well.</p>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p>“Bing: We do look at the social authority of a user. We look at how many people you follow, how many follow you, and this can add a little weight to a listing in regular search results. It carries much more weight in Bing Social Search, where tweets from more authoritative people will flow to the top when best match relevancy is used.”</p>
<p>“Google: Yes, we do use it as a signal. It is used as a signal in our organic and news rankings. We also use it to enhance our news universal by marking how many people shared an article.”</p>
</div>
<p>So the moral of the story is that it pays to have both social media and <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="SEO campaigns" target="_self">SEO campaigns</a> for your business working in sync with eachother.</p>

      <title>Does Internet Yellow Pages Advertising Suck? Real Customers Say...</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>I recently posted the following question on LinkedIn to get a feel for what people thought about using internet Yellow Pages advertising services.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p><strong>What is your experience with Yellowpages/AT&amp;T’s marketing services?  Good or Bad?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am wondering about the experiences different businesses have had using Yellowpages/AT&amp;T for<br> marketing their products or services. Please share your stories good or bad, and whether you<br> used their print advertising or their online marketing services.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Here are the answers I received.  And after reading these answers my assertion is that marketing your business through the <strong>Yellow Pages Sucks.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>I advertised in the yellow pages for one year. What did I get?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. A much higher phone bill. Gotta pay for the phone book bureaucracy, after all. </strong> <strong><br> 2. Numerous calls from price shoppers and job hunters. And one client. Who was a deadbeat.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Needless to say, I didn’t repeat my ad.</strong></p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p><strong>- Martha</strong></p>
<p>———————————————————————————————————————————–</p>
<p><strong>Ran a print ad for several years and attracted many (“how much?”) shoppers and a few local prospects with very low budgets. Our clients who have opted for online YP ads have shown them to perform poorly when they look at their website analytics with actual conversion to business being almost nil. The considerable expense just does not seem justified when one looks at the actual results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Pamela<br></strong></p>
<p><strong>——————————————————————————————————————————————</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yellow Pages?? Does ANYBODY use those now that there’s the internet?? I can honestly say I haven’t picked up a printed Yellow Pages to look for anything in at least FIVE YEARS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Steve</strong></p>
<p><strong>——————————————————————————————————————————————-</strong></p>
<p><strong>I used Yellowpages on-line last year – terrible results, I would not recommend, they talk big but the results are small, keep your money and put a little more sweat equity into marketing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Julia</strong></p>
<p><strong>——————————————————————————————————————————————-</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have had multiple clients that were burned by Yellowpages which required them to sign a yearly contract for services. Then when the clients got very little business from the listings, they were told that their listings received the required number of clicks, even though the clicks did not translate into business. A poor ROI in general.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Adam</strong></p>
<p><strong>—————————————————————————————————————————————</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have numerous clients drop from YellowPages and move those funds over to online marketing due to their poor results. But we still have some clients that still use them for high ROI lead generation.</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Yellow Pages and such are a dying breed especially with the recent Google Local update that has taken place. Google is really trying to drive traffic to their Place pages and away from online Yellow Pages. Driving visitors to Google Place pages provides an additional point of interaction for the visitor to see their Google Ads. Which means more money in Google’s pocket.</strong></p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p><strong>-Brent</strong></p>
<p><strong>—————————————————————————————————————————————–</strong></p>
</div>
<p>These are just of a few of the responses to my question.  The response as you can see is overwhelmingly negative.  The Yellow Pages quite frankly don’t work any longer, they are a dinosaur.  Very few people search for products or services in the book anymore and the <strong>Yellow Pages online advertising  services </strong>are extremely poor if not useless.</p>
<p>I get a bad taste in my mouth when I think about this company.  Many of our current clients are former Yellow Page/AT&amp;T clients and I can’t tell you how many of them have nightmare stories about how much money the blew and how poorly they were treated.</p>

<p>In our previous post you learned about using Google search operators to find topical sites that are related to your business or niche.  Today I want to expand on that idea and show you how to find easy linking partners using <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="Google SEO" target="_self">Google SEO</a> footprints.</p>
<p>Google SEO footprints are the identifying marks that are left throughout the internet by virtually every website and blog.  And they can be extremely valuable tools for <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="improving Google ranking" target="_self">improving Google ranking</a>.</p>
<p>Many sites throughout the internet are built on similar platforms.  There are thousands of blogs out there built on the WordPress platform and still thousands more built on Typepad.  Many people who create forums or membership sites use the platforms ExpressionEngine, SMF, and Elgg among many others.  And each one of these platforms leaves a special signature or Search engine footprints that makes it easy for the search engines to identify and list for savvy SEO’s looking for easy backlinking partners.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to find Word Press blogs to comment on that were relevant to your niche you could use the following wordpress blog footprint:</p>
<p><strong>“powered by wordpress” “your keyword”</strong></p>
<p>Blogs offer a chance to build backlinks very easily.  You can either find a post and write a quality comment or you could approach the blog owner for a guest post opportunity.  By approaching the blog owner you can often build a valuable linking relationship for your business and have a great place to find future links for your website.</p>
<p>Forums are another opportunity for easy linking partners. You can find related forums, create a profile, and drop anchor text links in your signature. These are great links and you can usually drop 3 or 4 anchor text links in your signature box, so these become extremely valuable when you find high PR relevant forums. Here is an example of how to find a forum on the ExpressionEngine platform that is related to your niche using its search footprint.</p>
<p><strong>“powered by ExpressionEngine” “your keyword”</strong></p>
<p>So as you can see using these Google footprints can be an awesome linkbuilding tool for your arsenal. Happy link hunting!</p>

      <title>Guide To Improving Google Ranking: Using Search Operators </title>

	<center><img id="img-1320706529956" src="/Portals/123780/images/GoogleSearchoperators.jpg" alt="Google SEarch Operators" title="Google Search Operators" width="275" height="275"></center>The first step in creating any solid linkbuilding campaign is finding potential link partners with sites that are relevant to your business.  One of the best ways to find these potential partners is by using <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators.html" target="_blank">search operators for Google</a>.
<p>Google search operators are words or symbols that tells Google what type of results to include in the Search Engine Results page.   Here are some Google operators and what results they would bring back</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>intitle:Keyword</strong> – restricts results to pages containing <em><code>the keyword </code></em> in the title.  Ex:  intitle:”dog training” would only bring back only results with “dog training” in the title of the page (the clickable blue link in the result)</li>
<li>
<strong>inurl:Keyword</strong> – restricts results to pages containing <em><code>the keyword </code></em> in the title.  Ex:  inurl:”dog training” would only bring back only results with “dog training” in the url of the page (www.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">dogtraining</span>experts or www.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">dogtraining</span>online.com)</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see using these <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators.html" target="_blank">google search operators</a> when performing a search can help you find websites containing content that is relevant to your business.  Now your job is to go out and get links to these websites.  Some of these links will be easier to get than others.  For instance if you find blogs using these keyword search operators you could either comment on a post within the site or approach the owner of the blog and see if you could write a guest post for them and include links to your site.  If you find forums using these search operators in Google, you can create profiles and create signatures with anchor text links pointing back to your site.</p>
<p>In our next post we will talk about using search “footprints” that will help you actually find these sites that make it easier on you to get links from like directories, blogs, and forums, so stay tuned it’s gonna get good.</p>

      <title>Guide To Improving Google Ranking – Step 5 Competitive Analysis</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[

<p><img id="img-1320706707893" src="/Portals/123780/images/competitive-analysis.png" alt="Atlanta SEO Competitive Analysis" title="Competitve Analysis" width="210" height="217"></p>
</center>
<p>After optimizing your business website for the keywords you wish to rank for the next step for <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="improving Google ranking" target="_self">improving Google ranking</a> is to knowing exactly what it is going to take to beat out your competition.  To do this we will show you how to perform in depth competitive analysis.</p>
<p>The first step in analyzing your competition is to do a Google search for your targeted keyword.  Next you want to analyze the top 10 results for this keyword search.</p>
<p>Here are the things you want to analyze:  Do these businesses have the keyword in their URL?  Do they have the keyword in their title (the blue clickable link in the listing)? Do they have the keyword in their description (the short summary of what the sites about below the title)?  How many links do they have pointing at their site (find number of backlinks using <a href="https://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com" target="_blank">yahoo site explorer</a>)?  How many of these links use the keyword as an anchor text link (read about <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.web11.hubspot.com/blog/bid/63233/Atlanta-SEO-Guide-For-Better-Google-Rankings-Step-4-Anchor-Text" target="_blank">anchor text here</a>)?</p>
<p>Analyze each of the top 10 results to see what you need to do with your site in order to surpass these listings.  All these factors play a part in ranking.  As a best practice, you should already have the keyword in your title and description if you have optimized your site correctly.  You may or may not have the keyword in your URL and that is something you can look into, but it is not mandatory.</p>
<p>The most important thing to look at is the backlinks and anchor text.  In a perfect world, to beat out the competition all you would need to do is obtain a backlink from each site your competitor has a backlink from and then just add more backlinks.  But it is impossible to get all of the links your competitor has.  So just get as many of your competitors links as you can, then use the backlinking strategies we are going to talk about as we continue with this series and with time you should outrank the competition.</p>

<p>If you’ve been following our <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="Atlanta SEO" target="_self">Atlanta SEO</a> guide to better Google rankings, we’ve been discussing onpage optimization for your Atlanta business website.  On page optimization is one of the two factors that will help your business website achieve better Google rankings.</p>

<p>If you own a local business and are marketing your business through the traditional advertising channels i.e. yellowpages ads, newspaper ads, radio spots, etc. then you had better snap out of it quick.  Traditional marketing is DEAD I repeat DEAD.  People no longer use these dinosaurs to shop for products or services in their local areas.</p>
<p>These days you must have a website and you must have presence and visibility on search engines like Google, Bing, as well as having company pages on the major social networking sites.</p>
<p>One of the best ways for local customers to find your business is to rank well <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/"></a>using <a href="/google-places-optimization/" title="Google Places Optimization" target="_self">Google Places Optimization</a> for keywords that describe your business.  Recently I came across a question on LinkedIn where someone was asking how to perform <a href="/google-places-optimization/" title="Google Places Optimisation" target="_self">Google Places Optimisation</a>.  You can read the question below.</p>
<p>——————————————————————————————————————————————–</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p><strong>How do you Achieve Top 3 Position On Google Places Results?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Google places optimization now provides the opportunity for free 1st Page Google Positioning under “Local Business Results”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I would like to know how to get positioned within the top 3 search results?<br> 1) Is there a means of doing this over and above standard SEO/Keyword &amp; Linking Strategy approaches? 2) is there a premium version through added fees that can get you positioned within the top 3?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Very much appreciate those expert experience based recommendations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you. Paul Gothier</strong></p>

<p>Here was my response…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Hi Paul,</strong></p>
<p><strong>The majority of answers you’ve received are incorrect. To achieve hi rankings in Google places cannot be guaranteed, but if you do the following, your chances increase tremendously. </strong></p>
<p><strong>1)Create a Google <a href="/google-places-optimization/" title="business listing in Google Places" target="_self">business listing in Google Places</a>, and claim this listing via phone code or direct mail code </strong></p>
<p><strong>2)As best practice address should be near the center of the city you want to show up in, should be a physical address not a P.O. box, and should have a local phone # </strong></p>
<p><strong>3)Optimize listing for keywords you want to be found under – add keywords in categories, description, services, etc. </strong></p>
<p><strong>4)Complete every section of listing – add pics, video, coupons, etc. </strong></p>
<p><strong>5)Add this listing to local business directories – yellowpages, superpages, manta, kudzu, yelp, etc… There are hundreds. Also add your listing to data aggregators like infousa.com. These are whats called citations and are probably one of the biggest factors for local search </strong></p>
<p><strong>6)Claim as many of these listings as possible – delete any duplicate listings as duplicates can count against you. </strong></p>
<p><strong>7)Positive reviews on all these directories help your local listings as well. Solicit current clients to give you positive reviews on these directories as well as your Google local listing. </strong></p>
<p><strong>To get an idea of the number of citations you might need and what directories you can list in, you should do competitive analysis on bing local. This gives you a listing of your top competitors citations and where to get them. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hope this helps. If you don’t have the time to perform this activities yourself. My company can help. Give us a call 404-627-0612. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks, </strong> <strong><br> Ron Medlin</strong></p>

      <title>Guide For Improving Google Ranking – Step 4 Anchor Text</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[

<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/anchor-and-chain.jpg" border="0" alt="anchor and chain" title="Anchor Text" width="400" height="300" class="alignCenter" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
</center>
<p>One of the keys to <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="improving Google ranking" target="_self">improving Google ranking</a> is the proper use of anchor text for both internal linking (linking between pages on your site) and external linking (linking to your site from someone else’s site).</p>
<p>Anchor text is basically just a clickable text link.  Here is the definition right from Wikipedia, “the anchor text, a link label or link title is the visible, clickable text in a hyperlink.  The words contained in the Anchor text can determine the ranking that page will receive by search engines.”</p>
<p>These clickable keywords, or anchor text links, make it easier on search engine robots to determine what the site the text is linking to is actually about.  So whether linking between pages on your own site or linking from other sites, use the proper anchor text and link to the appropriate pages on your site.</p>
<p>To illustrate this let’s say you have a page on your site specifically about wiener dog training.  You’ve optimized the site like we’ve talked about by putting “wiener dog training” in your meta tags and the other strategic places we’ve discussed, so when the search engine robots scan your site they know that page is about wiener dog training.  Now to further support the on page work you’ve already done need a incoming link from another site, but not just any link.  You need a link from a related web site using the anchor text “wiener dog training.”</p>
<p>We’re really getting rolling here.  I hope your enjoying the content by our <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/">Atlanta SEO expert</a><a href="/atlanta-seo-services/">s</a>.  Feel free to leave any comments or suggestions on content you would like to read.</p>

      <title>Guide For Improving Google Ranking – Longtail Keyword Strategy</title>

</center>
<p>Every good <a href="#" target="_blank"></a>strategy for <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="improving Google ranking" target="_self">improving Google ranking</a> should incorporate the use of a variety of keyword phrases.  Some keywords should be utilized for the sheer fact that they can bring massive amounts of traffic to your website.  Others should be involved because they bring traffic that converts.</p>
<p>Some of the best keywords are what we call “long-tail keywords.” <strong>Long tail keywords</strong> are those three and four word phrases which are very, very specific to whatever product or service you are selling.</p>
<p>Searchers using these types of keywords are ready to buy, for this reason, these types of phrases are sometimes known as “buying keywords.”  So while these terms aren’t searched as often as the broader terms, they often convert at a much higher rate, making them in some cases even more valuable.  And if you <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="rank high on Google" target="_self">rank high on Google</a> for enough of these high converting keywords, the traffic starts to add up.  So not only are you getting decent traffic from them, but it’s traffic that will turn into revenue.</p>
<p>The  lesson here is that your keyword research strategy should involve a mixture of broad high traffic keywords and long-tail buying keywords.  Follow this recipe and you will win and win big.</p>

</center>
<p>If you’ve been reading the <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/">Atlanta SEO</a> guide series, I’d like to formally apologize.  I left out a HUGE step that should be the cornerstone of any strategy for <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="improving Google ranking" target="_self">improving Google ranking</a>, and that is keyword research.   Sorry I left this out, but how bout I make it up to you.   I’ll give it a shot…</p>
<p><a href="/atlanta-seo-services/">Keyword research strategy</a> is extremely important and should be done before starting any of the previous steps we’ve discussed in this series.  When doing keyword research, take your time and come up with a plan.  The rest of your campaign will be determined by the keywords you choose.</p>
<p>So how do you do keyword research?  Well, there are hundreds of good tools out there for keyword research, some paid, some free.  But my favorite is the free <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" target="_blank">Google keyword research tool</a>.</p>
<p>The new platform makes it really easy to sort your keywords into particular themes, which can be really helpful.  It’s a great tool.</p>
<p>I like to go to the Google keyword tool and type in my main keyword and some variations of that keyword.  Say I was a dentist in Atlanta, I would type in “Atlanta Dentist”, “Atlanta Dental”, “Dentist in Atlanta”, “Atlanta Dentistry”, you get the picture.  Then I would hit search and the tool will go out and populate a list of terms related to the words we typed in.  I would then sort this list based on search volume.</p>
<p>Common sense tells us we want to go after the keywords that get the most search volume and will bring the most visitors to our sites.  Go through this list and choose the words that are most relevant and provide the highest search traffic for your site.  These are the words you will want to use when optimizing your website.  But we shouldn’t limit our keyword research strategy to high search volume keywords.</p>

      <title>Guide For Improving Google Ranking - Good Keyword Density </title>

</center>
<p>Another thing to consider when optimizing the pages on your website and <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="improving Google ranking" target="_self">improving Google ranking</a>, is the number of times your primary keyword phrase shows up in the content of your page, aka your keyword density.</p>
<p>There is a lot of debate on what the perfect keyword density of one’s website content should be.  As a general rule of thumb keyword density should be around 3%.  In other words you want your primary keyword to show up 3 times for every 100 words of content you have on the page.</p>
<p>Yes, the 3% keyword density is a good rule to follow, but when writing the content for your pages, you should also sprinkle in variations of the primary keyword to further build on the overall theme of the page.   Here’s an example, Primary Keyword “<a href="/atlanta-seo-services/">Atlanta SEO Company</a>” – Variation “<a href="/atlanta-seo-services/">SEO Company in Atlanta</a>.”</p>
<p>When you write your page content using these strategies, you will not only <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="rank high on Google" target="_self">rank high on Google</a> for your primary keyword phrase, but also the variations you use in the content as well.</p>

<p>In the previous post of our ongoing <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" target="_self">Atlanta SEO</a> guide for <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="improving Google ranking" target="_self">improving Google ranking</a> series, we discussed the first step in optimizing the different pages on your business website.  We explained to you specifically what meta tags were and how search engines determine what your site is about by reading these tags in the source code of your site.  We also talked about the importance of having the 2 or 3 most relevant keywords for  each page in both your meta title tag and your meta description tag for that page.</p>
<p>In this page we will continue teaching you about on page optimization, because while the meta tags might be the most significant, there are other parts of your page that you also need to pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Let’s first talk about the H1 tags, again this is just another part of the code that Google reads when they scan your website.  Basically the H1 tags are going to be the headlines on your page.  Anywhere you see a headline with large font on a page generally these are H1 tags.  So you need to use the keywords you have chosen in the headlines of your pages.  Subheadlines are also a good spot to place your keywords just don’t overdo it.</p>
<p>Moving on… choose a few instances to bold, underline, and italicize these keywords in the body content on each page.   Google spiders also tend to read sections of your page where there is obvious emphasis on certain words using these different formats.</p>
<p>Using pictures can brighten up webpages and make them more attractive, but you can also use these images to <a href="/atlanta-seo-services/" title="rank high on Google" target="_self">rank high on Google</a>.  How?  Well, when you add images to a website using any of the various types of website editors you have the opportunity to add what are called alt tags.  Alt tags are just text descriptions of the image.  They were created so that blind people who can’t see the images are able to tell what the pictures are.  Alt tags are another opportunity to stick in your keywords and let Google know what your sites about.</p>
<p>Well I think that’s enough for today, but check back soon.  We’ve got plenty of great <a href="/low-cost-website-design/">Atlanta website optimization</a> content coming up.</p>

      <title>Atlanta SEO Guide For Improving Google Rankings – Step 1 Meta-Tags</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>So the question I keep getting asked is:  How do I optimize my website so I come up in the search engine rankings?</p>
<p>Firstly, if your website is outdated, then you need to think about investing in a redesign or, at the very least, an update for your website.  It is much easier to optimize your all-important meta-tags if you start from scratch and build your website around the keywords that are being searched for on the internet.</p>
<p>What are meta-tags?  These are titles and descriptions that Google uses to determine the content of each page of your website.  They are hidden in the code that Google’s crawlers read and are not visible on the webpage itself.  Ideally, every single web page you have on your site should have a meta title tag and a meta description tag that focuses on the major keywords that the page is trying to rank for.   If you have keyword-specific meta-tags and your content is solid, then you have taken your first step toward ranking on Google.</p>
<p>Here is an example.  If you run an Atlanta-based European auto-repair company, you would want to have a different page on your website for each manufacturer that you repair,  BMW, Mercedes, Saab, etc.   And each of these pages should have it’s title and description meta-tags optimized to focus on keywords that someone might type in about repairing their European-made car.  This is how google knows exactly what a particular web page is claiming to be about.</p>
<p>Here is a quick tool you can use to create your meta-tags.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addme.com/meta.htm">http://www.addme.com/meta.htm</a></p>
<p>Just type in your title and description and hit “Get Tags” and you’ll get a piece of code.  Paste this code in between the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tags in your websites source code.  Don’t know how to do this?  Call us, we can help.</p>

</center>
<p>By integrating <a href="/affordable-email-marketing/">small business email marketing</a> with other online marketing channels, small business owners are able to fully capitalize on one of the most popular and effective promotional tactics in the history of marketing.   Email marketing for small business is the internet generation’s version of sending out direct mail advertisements to potential customers only faster, measurable, and far more cost effective.</p>
<p>A recent stat from the Direct Marketing Association says that the ROI for email marketing in 2009 was $43.62 for every $1 spent.  As you can see that email marketing is a godsend for the budget-conscious small business owner, because it allows them to convert new customers and generate revenue with little investment.  If these stats aren’t enough to peak your interest in small business email marketing, then check out these advantages of this online promotion strategy.</p>
<p><strong>1.  Global reach</strong>:<br> No matter who your market is or where they live, <a href="/affordable-email-marketing/">small business email marketing</a> has the ability to reach every corner of the globe.  If there’s an internet connection and they get email, you can market to them.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Lower cost:</strong> Costs accrued through the creation, sending, testing/measuring, and receiving of an email is a little over 70% lower than a direct mail campaign of 5000 marketing pieces. By adding e-mail to your marketing efforts, you spend less time, money and resources than with traditional marketing channels like direct mail or print advertising.</p>
<p><strong>3.  24 hr marketing </strong> With an email the audience can understand your offering even when you are out of office.</p>
<p><strong>4.  It’s instant</strong><br> Unlike snail mail, email can be sent, received, and opened within a matter of minutes.  No more waiting days or weeks even for your potential customers to receive your promotions, one click and in seconds your offer is there waiting in their inbox to be opened..</p>
<p><strong>5.  Targeted audience</strong> When you build your own email list through highly targeted landing pages, you are able to target any demographic you want whether it be based on geography, age, income, spends, and many other parameters.  Then you can promote offers which are appropriate to that demographic making your marketing efforts very targeted resulting in higher conversion rates and better ROI.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Personalization</strong><br> Small business email marketing allows you to personalize each and every one of the messages you send to potential customers creating a special bond between you and the prospect.  People buy from people not from companies.  It’s all about building trust.</p>
<p><strong>7.  Measurable results</strong><br> One of the biggest benefits of small business email marketing is that results can be accurately tested and measured.   Measuring opens, click-through rates, conversion rates, and more, enables businesses to assess the success of different email campaigns, so that they can be tweaked and improved to yield better results.</p>
<p>When used in conjunction of other online marketing strategies, particularly traffic generation tactics like SEO, PPC, social media marketing, video marketing, etc., small business email marketing has the power to bring huge benefits to your business. Get started right now and create targeted e-marketing campaigns and watch your profits grow. Many of your competitors are doing it already!</p>

	<p>Google mobile tap is a cool new feature that allows you to link your smartphone with your Google.com account. One of the neatest things about using Google mobile tap is that you can star places of interest you from your computer and they will show up on your phone though local search on Google maps.</p>

All you would have to do is find these vineyards on Google Maps and star them from your computer. When you get to the wine country just log in to your Google.com account right from your phone, hit the local tab, click on your starred listings, and shazaam your favorite vineyards are right there with a map giving your directions. Below is a quick tutorial on exactly how to set this up.</p>

      <title>How Dental Internet Marketing Can Help Grow Your Dental Practice</title>

<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/dentist-721070.jpg" border="0" alt="dental internet marketing" width="486" height="387"></p>
<p>As the internet, Google, and social media (Facebook just reached more visitors than Google) gain popularity each day, <a href="#">dental internet marketing</a> has become an essential strategy for any new or struggling dental practices to grow their client base.</p>
<p>Just a few facts for you, there are over 220 million internet users in the U.S. alone and over 1.4 Billion world wide as of the end of 2008. Compete.com released a study stating that 94% of consumers do research online before making any purchases or paying for any services.</p>
<p>Gone are the days where a potential patient would look your office up in the yellow pages, give you a call, and set an appointment. The yellow pages and print ads in general are dinosaurs. It’s time to face the facts, the internet is the place to be for marketing any business. Luckily there is plenty of upside to dental internet marketing. It’s faster, cheaper, and much more efficient due to measurable results. Enough said?</p>
<p>So where do you start with dental internet marketing? Well first and foremost you need a website. The site should be attractive, easy to navigate, informative, and have personality (lots of pictures breaking up the text). It should also be optimized for relevant keywords that your potential patients would use to search for your dental practice.</p>
<p>The site should have an email sign up form to collect email addresses for potential clients so that you can send them promotions, also your offices contact information should be on every page and easy to find.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got a website your satisfied now you need to attract prospective clients. How you ask? Well this is where the fun part of dental online marketing begins, driving traffic. The best way we’ve found to bring in potential dental clients is through Search Engine Marketing (SEM).</p>
<p>There are 3 sections you dental website can show up on a search engine results page (serp) when a potential client does a search on a relevant keyword.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/dentistserp.jpg" border="0" alt="dental internet marketing" width="472" height="410"></p>
<p>The first section, outlined in red, is the local search section.  This section consists of local business listings submitted to Google local business directory.  Certain techniques can be used to raise your ranking in this section including optimizing your Google local listing to include keywords you want to show up in.</p>
<p>The section outlined in blue is known as the paid search section.  This section consists of pay per click adverts where the advertiser pays  Google each time someone clicks on their ad.  The cost per click is determined by how many advertisers are bidding on each particular keyword.  The more popular the keyword the higher the CPC.  Some of the benefits of Pay-Per-Click advertising are that high rankings can be achieved immediately and results are fully measurable so that campaigns can be optimized to produce a higher ROI.  This is a place to start your dental internet marketing.</p>
<p>The last section, outlined in green, is the organic search results.  High rankings in this section come from using Search Engine Optimization strategies.  SEO uses a combination of on-site optimization and backlinking to outrank competitors websites.  Find a  savvy SEO company that knows how to use white hat (legitimate) techniques to produce fast results and you’ll be smiling all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>The goal for your <a href="#">dental online marketing</a> plan should be to show up in each section of the Google search results page, and if possible more than once.  These is probably the best approach to start marketing you dental practice online, but there is a whole arsenal of online marketing techniques that can be utilized to drive traffic and bring in clients.  Any dentists out there interested in growing their dental practice really need to investigate the option on online marketing, you better believe your competitors will!</p>

<p> Ever wondered <a href="/social-media-marketing/">why social media</a>? What’s so great about these social networking sites that has everybody all excited? Isn’t it just a place for kids to hangout online with there buddies and talk about the hottie in the latest teen vampire movie?</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>Understanding social media and how it works can be an extremely valuable tool for any company. It builds brand awareness, connects with customers, and gives the company an all important feedback loop to help them improve their products or services and find out exactly what their customers want.</p>

      <title>3 Qualities of Good Pay Per Click Management Companies</title>

</center>
<p>When searching for quality <a href="/ppc-pay-per-click-internet-marketing/">pay per click management companies</a> to create, manage, and optimize your pay per click campaigns there are several vital things you should consider.</p>
<p>First off, you should ask them to give you a rundown of their overall strategy for your PPC campaigns.  A good pay per click management company should be able to explain exactly what they believe will be the most effective strategy to promote your company using pay per click.</p>
<p>What is their process for setting up an adwords campaign?  What keywords are they going to target?  Would your site do better with a national campaign, local campaign, or both?  Would your particular product or service perform well on both the content and  search networks on Google?  Should you start with one search engine then roll it out to the others or launch all at once?  Would using social media PPC bring you a high conversion rate?  How do they plan on tracking conversions?</p>
<p>Do your research on pay per click marketing and make sure to ask questions.  By doing this you gain knowledge on the overall process and you show whoever you’re talking to that you really know your stuff.  If they fumble through any of the answers then you know it’s time to move on and interview someone else.</p>
<p>Next, do they have any special pay per click tools or software to help them create more profitable campaigns.  There are lots of PPC tools out there that enable pay per click management companies to create profitable campaigns faster and more efficiently.  If the company your talking to is not using any of these pay per click gadgets then chances are they won’t be able to produce the results that a company with an arsenal of tools can, at least not as quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, will they use pay per click to help them build a  search engine optimization strategy based on high converting keywords?  If you want to turn your website into a conversion machine and close more customers you really should find <a href="/ppc-pay-per-click-internet-marketing/">pay per click management companies</a> that will help you dominate both the paid search results and the organic results.</p>
<p>You need to look for full service internet marketing firms.  A company who will not only handle all your PPC needs, but use those results to build out an SEO campaign using only the highest converting keywords.  This makes the whole online marketing process very fast and extremely efficient.</p>
<p>So if you’re out there searching for the right PPC management company keep these things in mind and don’t just settle or you will regret it.</p>

      <title>How to Get More Customers Using A “Multi-Channel” Approach</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>In this day and age, <a href="/how-to-get-more-customers/" title="getting more customers" target="_self">getting more customers</a> is vital to the growth and health of any business no matter what industry you’re in.  Despite what we’ve been programmed to believe, traditional marketing is falling by the waste side.  It’s too expensive and quite frankly has become obsolete.</p>
<p>We see newspaper after newspaper going bankrupt, terrestrial radio is being overtaken by commercial free satellite radio, people now use TIVO and fast forward through TV commercials.  Even with magazine ads you’re lucky if you <a href="/how-to-get-more-customers/" title="get customers" target="_self">get customers</a> to take the time to look at them and you’re spending a fortune in the process.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reason’s that traditional marketing is now in a downward spiral is because we now have a cheaper, faster, measurable, and more effective way to market any business, THE INTERNET.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that Google is one of the most powerful fastest growing companies in the world.  <strong>Targeted internet marketing</strong> isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, and as a business owner if you don’t participate you will be left behind plain and simple.</p>
<p>The most effective way to <a href="/how-to-get-more-customers/" title="get more customers" target="_self">get more customers</a> over the internet is by using what I like to call a  “Multi-Channel” approach to targeted internet marketing.  By combining the most effective online marketing strategies available, your business can <a href="/how-to-get-more-customers/" title="reach more customers" target="_self">reach more customers</a> who are actively searching for your product or service, follow up with those people, and convert them into lifelong clients.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/intermarketingprocess.jpg" border="0" alt="Targeted Internet Marketing" width="444" height="488"></p>
<p>The first step in the “Multi-channel” approach is to use analytics on your site.  This gives you the ability to track who is coming to your website, where they are coming from, and where they are hanging out on your site.  Using this information you can optimize your marketing to <a href="/how-to-get-more-customers/" title="find more customers" target="_self">find more customers</a>.</p>
<p>The next step is setting up your site to collect email information.  By doing this, potential customers who sign up for your email list are actually giving you permission to market and promote your business to them via email.  The PERFECT CUSTOMER!</p>
<p>Next, you need to drive traffic to your website from sources all over the web.  Several techniques for driving targeted internet marketing traffic include search engine optimization, pay per click advertising, social media marketing, niche marketing, etc.  All of which can drive traffic and for the best results should be done simultaneously.</p>
<p>Finally after you’ve started to see an increase in traffic to your site, it’s time to turn that website into a conversion machine.  To do this, you must test and track different variables on the page to see what combination works the best.  “Always be testing,”  words to live by.</p>

      <title>Google Superbowl XLIV Commercial 2010, Touching And Powerful!</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>In a year where we were bombarded with Superbowl ads of men in their tighty whitey’s and less than humorous Doritos spots, the Google Superbowl XLIV Commercial 2010 scored a big win.</p>
<p>The 2010 Google Superbowl Ad was smart and simple as it told a touching story of Parisian love.  This romantic story accomplished two things that night, not only was it able to reach us at an emotional level (marketing 101), but what Google really accomplished in a big way was to show consumers just how powerful and necessary their service actually is.  The #1 search engine on the planet once again shows us exactly why they have become an absolute monster… great product and great marketing.</p>
<p>If you missed it you can check out the Google Superbowl XLIV Commercial 2010 below:</p>

      <title>Dominate The 3 Sections Of A Search Engine Results Page (SERP) And Win More Clients</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>“A search engine results page (SERP), is the listing of web pages returned by a search engine in response to a keyword query.”   There are three main sections on a SERP where your site can show up and in turn bring potential customers back to your website.  Showing up in all three of these different sections gives you a significant advantage over your competitors and makes your website highly visible to people actively searching for your product or service, which is very powerful.  Below you will see a screenshot of a search engine results page with these three sections separated by different colors:</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/123780/images/serp3.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket" width="486" height="620"></p>
<p>The listings in the first section outlined in blue are the paid results.  These are sponsored advertisements where a company actually pays Google a certain price each time  someone clicks on their link (cost per click).  These are commonly known as  Pay Per Click (PPC) advertisements.  PPC can be very tricky and if done incorrectly Google has been known to penalize advertisers by charging them inflated costs per click.  Starting a PPC campaign without any training is highly unadvised and can end up costing thousands of dollars with little results.</p>
<p>The next section highlighted in red is the local search results.  These listings represent local businesses who have submitted their site into Google’s local business directory.   Using business listing optimization techniques along with multiple directory submissions, companies are able to make it into what is called the seven pack of local search.  If your site makes it into these positions there is a good chance you will start to see an influx of free highly targeted traffic to your website.  There is also a good chance this traffic will convert into leads or clients for your business as well because these visitors are so highly targeted to your specific product or service.</p>
<p>The last section in green is what is known as the organic search results.  This is also 100% free traffic.  To make it to the first page of Google and ultimately one of the top three positions on the page for organic search, you must use what are known as <a href="http://searchdogmarketing.com/atlanta-seo-services" title="Search Engine Optimization (SEO)" target="_self">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a> techniques.  SEO incorporates a mixture of both on-page and off-page factors to bring your site the results and rankings you desire.   SEO is an ongoing long term  strategy that must be done correctly and naturally or your site stands the chance of getting its rankings penalized or in some cases Google may de-index your site.</p>
<p>As you can see these three sections can all provide your site with targeted traffic, but just think of the possibilities and potential traffic you could be getting when you dominate the search engine results page and show up in all three of these sections.  You could be bringing in more traffic and converting new clients than you can even handle if you choose the right keywords.  But as we said in the previous paragraphs above the strategies you need to use to get the results you desire are highly advanced and are not for newbies.  So If you want to dominate the 3 sections of a SERP you should seek out a company of talented internet marketers who have undergone in depth training in all these strategies so that you can make sure that its done the right way and avoid disaster.</p>
