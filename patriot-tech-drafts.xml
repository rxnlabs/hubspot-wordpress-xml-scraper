      <title>Continuous Monitoring – A Critical Aspect of Risk Management</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Many organizations have recently discovered that - while traditional security monitoring systems can help reduce risk, they are not enough to react to today’s external, targeted, persistent, zero-day attacks. As a result, a number of Federal agencies and some private sector organizations are beginning to replace point-in-time audits and compliance checks with a Continuous Monitoring program to help them simultaneously assess the effectiveness of controls and provide visibility into current threats through situational awareness in a more efficient and effective automated fashion.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) first described continuous monitoring as a critical component of its Risk Management Framework, when in its <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-37-rev1/sp800-37-rev1-final.pdf" title="Special Publication 800-37 Rev 1" target="_self">Special Publication 800-37 Rev 1</a>, “Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach” it advised agencies to put in place the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration Management and Change Control: Develop processes for organizational information systems, throughout their SDLCs, and with consideration of their operating environments and their role(s) in supporting the organization’s missions and core business processes;</li>
<li>Security Impact Analyses: Develop security impact analysis and conduct analyses to monitor for changes to organizational information systems and their environments of operation for any adverse security impact to systems, mission/business and/or organizational functions which said systems support;</li>
<li>(Ongoing) Assessment of System Security Controls: Develop assessment frequencies based on an organization-wide continuous monitoring strategy and individual system authorization strategies; and</li>
<li>Security Status Monitoring and Reporting: Communicate accurate and up-to-date security-related information to support ongoing management of information security risks and to enable data-driven risk mitigation decisions with minimal response times and acceptable data latencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the heart of understanding risk is understanding change. Any time a system changes from a known state - or ”baseline” - risk is incurred. Detecting and understanding changes is key to weighing the risk associated with a given change, and to taking appropriate actions. Precision and continuous change detection is, therefore, a fundamental component of IT risk mitigation. In addition, continuous checking of settings, configurations, and system behaviors to determine anomalies is crucial to closing the risk detection and mitigation gap.</p>
<p>One of the ﬁrst major challenges in developing a strategy for implementing a continuous monitoring effort, however, is deﬁning the term. There have been a number of attempts: NIST has produced two documents that seek to deﬁne and provide guidance on the subject of continuous monitoring. The ﬁrst of these documents is a <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/documents/faq-continuous-monitoring.pdf" title="Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)" target="_self">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> guide on continuous monitoring that was published in June 2010. The second of these guides is the draft publication for <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-137/SP800-137-Final.pdf" title="Special Publication 800-137" target="_self">Special Publication 800-137</a>, Information Security Continuous Monitoring for Federal Information Systems and Organization, released in December 2010. According to NIST, continuous monitoring was defined as follows:</p>
<p>“Information security continuous monitoring is deﬁned as maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk management decisions. The objective is to conduct ongoing monitoring of the security of an organization’s networks, information, and systems, and respond by accepting, avoiding/rejecting, transferring/sharing, or mitigating risk as situations change.”</p>
<p><img id="img-1327674255931" src="/Portals/10927/images/ISCM-Process.png" border="0" alt="ISCM Process" width="234" height="221"></p>
<p>More recently, NIST released three reports that are related to continuous monitoring. The first, <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/nistir-7756/Draft-NISTIR-7756_second-public-draft.pdf">NIST Interagency Report 7756 Second Public Draft</a>, “CAESARS Framework Extension: An Enterprise Continuous Monitoring Technical Reference Model” provides a reference model for organizations to collect data from across a diverse set of security tools, analyze the data, score the data, enable user queries and provide overall situational awareness.</p>
<p>The model is designed so organizations can meet these goals by leveraging their existing security tool investments and avoid designing and paying for custom solutions. It was developed using the Department of Homeland Security’s monitoring framework <b><em>Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational Awareness, and Risk Scoring</em></b> (or CAESARS) architecture as a starting point.</p>
<p>The second document, <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/nistir-7799/Draft-NISTIR-7799.pdf">NISTIR 7799</a>, “Continuous Monitoring Reference Model Workflow, Subsystem, and Interface Specifications” provides the technical specifications for the continuous monitoring reference model presented in NISTIR 7756 with enough specificity to enable instrumentation of existing products and development of new capabilities by vendors.</p>
<p>The third document, <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/nistir-7800/Draft-NISTIR-7800.pdf">NISTIR 7800</a>, “Applying the Continuous Monitoring Technical Reference Model to the Asset, Configuration and Vulnerability Management Domains” augments the reference model with guidance on addressing these specific areas. It does this by leveraging the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) version 1.2 for configuration and vulnerability-scan content, and it recommends reporting results in an SCAP-compliant format.</p>
<p>While the initial thrust of continuous monitoring is controls-based in the Federal government, many forward-thinking organizations have expanded their continuous monitoring program to address threat management via Situational Awareness and Incident Response (SAIR). The result is a two-pronged approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proactive Monitoring: Vulnerability monitoring and asset/device awareness</li>
<li>Detective Monitoring: Full-view, context-aware threat monitoring, analysis and alerting</li>
</ul>
<p>The various “domains” that are candidates for continuous monitoring include the following:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="319">Asset Management</td>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>Configuration Management</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>Event Management</span>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>Incident Management</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>Information Management</span>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>License Management</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>Malware Detection and Remedy</span>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>Network Management</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>Patch Management</span>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>Vulnerability Management</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="319"> <span>Software Assurance</span>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="319">
<p> </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Although not (yet) specified, two other domains (Digital Policy Management and Advanced Persistent Threat) are under consideration by NIST.</p>
<p>By adopting a continuous monitoring program that addresses both proactive and reactive monitoring, organizations in both the public and private sector are able to not only manage compliance, but can track security trends, make risk management decisions, and determine where they need to improve security posture.</p>

      <title>An Introduction to IT Risk Management</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Managing IT risk is part of running any business these days. Regardless of the type of business, understanding and managing one’s IT risks will help to increase security, reduce management costs and achieve greater compliance. Managers who fail to identify, assess and mitigate IT risk are setting themselves up for serious security breaches, reputational damage, and financial losses. Further, those leaders who think that managing IT risk is the job solely of the IT staff may be in for a big shock.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to understand that Information is an asset that, like other important business assets, has value to an organization and therefore needs to be suitably protected. We need to ensure that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access, that we safeguard the accuracy and completeness of information, and that we ensure that authorized users have access to that information when required.</p>
<p>Before discussing how to go about determining one’s level of risk, it is important to understand risk nomenclature:</p>
<p>A <b><em>risk </em></b>is the possibility of a <b><em>threat </em></b>(or source) acting upon a <b><em>vulnerability</em></b> (or weakness) causing harm to an <em><strong>asset </strong></em>(or resource).</p>
<p>A risk is qualified (or measured) by what the <b><em>probability</em></b> (or likelihood) is of the event happening and what the <b><em>impact</em></b> (or severity) would be of<b><em> </em></b>the consequences.</p>
<p><b><em>Risk Management</em></b> is all about discovering your most critical assets and understanding their weaknesses and loss expectancy and then focusing your attention on the highest probability and highest impact areas in order to prioritize your risk treatment efforts.</p>
<p>The following figure (from ISO/IEC 15408, "Common Criteria") depicts the value relationship of owners to their assets. Ultimately the challenge is to introduce effective countermeasures (or safeguards) that restrict a threat agent (the catalyst that performs the threat) from successfully exploiting a known threat against an asset’s vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><img id="img-1325612279734" src="/Portals/10927/images/Risk%20Relationships.jpg" border="0" alt="Risk Relationships" width="610" height="438"></p>
<p>Before any risk analysis can be performed, a <b><em>Security Risk Profile</em></b> must first be created for the asset(s) in question. The security risk profile gathers information about the asset to help rate its sensitivity to security risks. Factors that are considered include Financial, Legal, and Reputational damages or Regulatory constraints/restrictions that may result from a security violation. It is important that a designated <b><em>Asset Owner</em></b> rates the asset’s importance to the organization from an information security perspective and within the context of the entire enterprise environment. Assets are normally assigned a value (High, Moderate, Low) relative to the organization’s tolerance for risk.</p>
<p>Once the risk is assessed, a Risk Map is used to plot the probability and impact of the risk occurring. The map allows one to visualize risks in relation to each other, gauge their extent, and plan what type of risk treatments should be implemented. Below is a simplified example of a Risk Map. As you can see, there are various risk treatments available to decision makers.</p>
<p><img id="img-1325534248465" src="/Portals/10927/images/Risk%20Treatment.gif" border="0" alt="describe the image" width="504" height="313"></p>
<p>By looking at the business risks this way, the most critical risks can be addressed and mitigated first.</p>
<p>It’s critical to the IT risk management process that executives not only be informed of risks, but that they assist in the quantification and definition of the business impact these risks impose. They need to sign off on the risk position adopted for the organization’s assets. Only when the IT department and senior management are aligned in the identification, assessment and remediation of IT risk will an organization be able to achieve higher levels of security and compliance.</p>
<p>By aggregating and reporting on the impact of security risks within IT and how these risks impact the business, security professionals can become an integral part of business decision-making and help guide the organization to a more risk-aware culture.</p>

      <title>New security attacks against Android smartphones</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>In 2008 Google launched the Android Market and estimates indicate there are now more than 200 million Android smartphones and tablets. And these smartphone and tablet users have downloaded over 10 billion applications from the Android Market.</p>
<p>With all that success, the Android application market has become an increasing target for cyber criminals.  In 2011 alone Google has removed more than 100 malicious applications from the Android Market.</p>
<p>Some of the tactics used by these criminals and hence things to monitor include malware bundled with fake applications. In this ruse the malicious app borrows elements of a legitimate app and then re-packages it with malicious code. In this category we find fake games, horoscopes, wallpapers and accessories to bestselling games such as "Angry Birds" and "Cut the Rope.”</p>
<p>Android targeted malware have been able to record keystrokes, send SMS messages to sign you up for 3rd party SMS services, record conversations, even factory reset a device without any input needed from the user.</p>
<p>One of the issues with the Android Market is that Google, unlike Microsoft and Apple, has not implemented a consistent program of vetting software submissions from developers and scanning applications for malware.</p>
<p>To combat this growing situation corporations with employees using Android powered devices are implementing remote security management systems for mobile devices. Functions and capabilities include: remote lock &amp; unlock, remote reset, remove configuration data, ability to lock management on phone, full device encryption, wipe encrypted data, SD card encryption, add blacklist, disable application, wipe application data, enable &amp; disable camera, enable &amp; disable wifi, enable &amp; disable microphone, enable &amp; disable enterprise applications, and prevent uninstall applications by user.</p>
<p>So this holiday season, make sure on your Santa wish list is some capability to securely manage the growing user base of Android devices.</p>

      <title>Human mind hacking predicted by security experts</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Continuing with our top lists for 2012, here are the "most outrageous security predictions" compiled for 2012.</p>
<p><b>Major sporting events draw major cyber attacks</b></p>
<p>The FIFA World Cup attracted much attention in 2010, with many victims falling for various scams, including counterfeit ticketing, fake merchandise and rogue travel agents. In the buildup to the 2012 Olympics look for criminals to use phishing techniques in offering fake tickets, spam that pushes other products but is littered with football references in the subject line and email body, fake travel and accommodation offers, and competitions for tickets and travel packages.</p>
<p><b>Cars  with computers will get hacked </b>By Stephen Northcutt<b></b></p>
<p>“This is fairly related to the OSI Layer 2 prediction. Cars aren't cars anymore, they are computers with wheels. GM ships OnStar, Ford has Synch, most states require "hands free" operation so we have Bluetooth. Cars even have their own networking protocol. In 2011 and 2012 most of the hacking activity against cars will be boutique, just seeing how to do it. It won't go into high gear unless someone can figure out how to monetize it. There is extortion of course, your wife is driving down an empty road at night in the cold and rain and the attacker uses something similar to the OnStar "Stolen Vehicle Assistance" to slow and stop the vehicle. Then the attacker demands your debit card number and PIN if you want the car to run again. That is one off and possibly requires human intervention and could be high risk to the criminal since you could call police on your cell phone and report the event. Of much greater concern is the eventual integration of your PDA to the car network especially if you get one of those nifty accept credit cards on your PDA applications.”</p>
<p><b>Human Mind Hacking </b>By Stephen Northcutt<b></b></p>
<p>“For over twenty years, there has been published information in the social sciences about planting false memories. A growing trend is when we are exposed to information that we do not like; you see this in politics a lot with the so-called liberal and conservative debate, the unwelcome information has a so-called backfire effect and reinforces our beliefs. If you listen carefully to someone that listens to Fox News all the time, you will come to realize Human Mind Hacking is real. Kathy and I ceased watching television over 25 years ago and I try to be careful about my news sources. You can never blindly trust in any one source…”</p>
<p><b>Peripherals Become Dangerous</b></p>
<p> In July 2010, there was an announcement that Dell Poweredge servers R410 replacement motherboards contained spyware. And we have seen digital picture frames, USB keys and the like that come with malware out of the box. However, it is only going to get worse. As organized crime seeks new ways to initially install malware as well as keep it in place in the presence of anti-virus software and endpoint whitelist technology, they will increasingly use device drivers and peripherals. In 2012, expect to read about more cases where malware is hidden in auxiliary parts of the computer and the operating system has no direct access. Also expect to see attacks against device drivers as well as malware pretending to be a device driver.</p>

      <title>Part 2 -Top  Expert Security Predictions for 2012</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Here is Part 2 of our top expert security predictions for 2012 compiled from M86, Websense, SecurEnvoy, CSO, SANS and others.</p>
<p><b>Mobile malware menaces users and organizations</b></p>
<p>In 2011, the most prolific cybercrime platforms, Zeus and Spyeye, developed malware for the Android platform in order to intercept the SMS-based security controls deployed by banks to protect their customers from banking Trojans. Android has become the most-targeted platform for malware, surpassing Symbian in the first half of 2011.</p>
<p><b>Third-party software exploits gain traction</b></p>
<p>Some third-party browser software such as Java, Flash Player and Acrobat Reader have huge worldwide install bases. Because numerous vulnerabilities in these products are found and often exploited, and because it is difficult for IT administrators to promptly update these products throughout their organizations, these software products have become an increasingly viable vector for attacks.</p>
<p><b>Exploit kits and malware reuse proliferate</b></p>
<p>Malware reuse is a growing phenomenon in the underground economy and the Zeus family of malware is a great example. For the last few years, Zeus (a.k.a. Zbot) functions as one of the preferred types of malware used by cybercriminals. Until May 2011, Zeus source code was sold only to private groups, and older compiled versions of the tool were available to anyone, but then the source code of Zeus crimeware kit was leaked and is now publicly available on the Web.</p>
<p><b>Compromised websites serving malicious content accelerates</b></p>
<p>Social networking sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn are now being used by businesses to promote their organizations, generate leads and inform customers of special offers or important messages. Additionally, almost every self-aware organization has either started a blog or is in the process of starting one. Regardless of the fact that these blogs run on corporate Web servers, they often are not sufficiently protected against malicious attacks, because they allow remote attackers such as Botnet operators and traders to compromise the corporate Web server, turning it into a redirector to their malware.</p>
<p><b>Botnets disruption attempts short-lived</b></p>
<p>Botnets, vast armies of compromised machines around the globe, are the cybercriminals’ weapons of choice, and nothing suggests that this will change anytime soon. Whether it’s spam, data stealing, DDOS, or mass website hacks, botnets provide the horsepower and anonymity that cybercriminals need to perpetuate their crimes. Unless the operators are actually apprehended, botnet takedowns tend to have a short-term effect only. The Cutwail and Lethic botnets are classic examples. Despite being ”disabled” multiple times, they are still spamming today.</p>
<p><b>Attacks on cloud services inevitable</b></p>
<p>Many people and organizations are moving to various cloud services to take advantage of convenience and attractive pricing. There are valid security concerns about moving sensitive data and critical systems to the cloud, including control of data, downtime due to an outage and lack of visibility. Despite excellent security practices employed by many cloud providers, the fact remains that these services are likely to be prime targets for cybercriminals.</p>
<p><b>Organizations will move from hardware to software based tokens to authenticate users</b></p>
<p>“While you could say this isn’t really a prediction, as in truth the exodus to tokenless has already started, I’ll bravely put a figure against it and say 50 percent of all hardware tokens will be replaced with tokenless two factor authentication by this time next year.”  - Andy Kemshall, SecurEnvoy</p>

      <title>Top  Expert Security Predictions for 2012 -  Pt 1</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>It’s that time of year again when we go through the security predictions for 2012 from the leading prognosticators and the wannabes. So until St. Nick comes, enjoy the “Top”  lists we’ve compiled from M86, Websense, SecurEnvoy, CSO, the folks at SANS and others. You’ll get a different “Top” list in the next few blogs until Christmas.</p>
<p><b>Targeted attacks grow more damaging and complex</b></p>
<p>Hacktivist groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec have made security breaches a public event as we learned about the use and rise of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) against global organizations and government agencies.</p>
<p><b>Illicit social media scams escalate</b></p>
<p>Social media has emerged as magnets for cybercriminals as malicious spam campaigns have mimicked Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter and even Google+, capitalizing on the inherent trust in these brands to dupe users into clicking on links.</p>
<p><b>Social media identity theft</b></p>
<p>Your social media identity may prove more valuable to cybercriminals than your credit cards. Bad guys will actively buy and sell social media credentials in online forums.</p>
<p><b>Blended attacks increase</b></p>
<p>The primary blended attack method used in the most advanced attacks will be to go through your social media "friends," mobile devices and through the cloud.</p>
<p>We've already seen one APT attack that used the chat functionality of a compromised social network account to get to the right user. Expect this to be the primary vector, along with mobile and cloud exploits, in the most persistent and advanced attacks of 2012</p>
<p><b>Rise of geospatial mobile device attacks</b></p>
<p>People have been predicting this for years, but in 2011 it actually started to happen. And watch out: the number of people who fall victim to believable social engineering scams will go through the roof if the bad guys find a way to use mobile location-based services to design hyperspecific geolocation social engineering attempts.</p>
<p><b>SSL/TLS will put net traffic into a corporate IT blind spot</b></p>
<p>Two items are increasing traffic over SSL/TLS secure tunnels for privacy and protection. First is the disruptive growth of mobile and tablet devices. And second, many of the largest, most commonly used websites, like Google, Facebook, and Twitter are switching to https sessions by default, ostensibly a more secure transmission. But as more traffic moves through encrypted tunnels, many traditional enterprise security defenses are going to be left looking for a threat needle in a haystack, since they cannot inspect the encoded traffic.</p>
<p><b>Containment is the new prevention</b></p>
<p>For years, security defenses have focused on keeping cybercrime and malware out. Organizations on the leading edge will implement outbound inspection and will focus on adapting prevention technologies to be more about containment, severing communications, and data loss mitigation after an initial infection.</p>
<p><b>Increase in event-based attacks</b></p>
<p>The London Olympics, U.S. presidential elections, Mayan calendar, and apocalyptic predictions will lead to broad attacks by criminals. Cybercriminals will continue to take advantage of today's 24-hour, up-to-the minute news cycle, only now they will infect users where they are less suspicious: sites designed to look like legitimate news services, Twitter feeds, Facebook posts/emails, LinkedIn updates, YouTube video comments, and forum conversations.</p>
<p><b>Social engineering and rogue anti-virus will continue to reign</b></p>
<p>Scareware tactics and the use of rogue anti-virus, which decreased a bit in 2011, will stage a comeback. Except, instead of seeing "You have been infected" pages, we anticipate three areas will emerge as growing scareware subcategories in 2012: a growth in fake registry clean-up, fake speed improvement software, and fake back-up software mimicking popular personal cloud backup systems.</p>

      <title>How to successfully secure a HPC system</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Yesterday we talked about the inherent differences and security risks between a High Performance Computing (HPC) system (computer clusters) and a traditional enterprise network.</p>
<p>In order to secure a cluster it must be treated as a single unit and not as a collection of independent networked machines and thus HPC requires  a different approach  from traditional enterprise-level security.</p>
<p>HPC systems present unique challenges to security administrators because of their following characteristics:</p>
<p>(1)    High bandwidth connections – To facilitate its computational goals, a cluster must have high bandwidth connections to the outside world, allowing interactive use by many users, transfer of large datasets into and out of the cluster, and fast inter-node communication. These high bandwidth connections are attractive to attackers because the attacker can subsequently leverage them for purposes such as launching denial-of-service flood attacks against other sites.</p>
<p>(2)    Extensive computational power – Legitimate cluster users marshal the aggregate processing power of multiple machines with the goal of solving grand challenge scientific problems. In contrast, this computational power could be used by an attacker for purposes such as carrying out brute-force attacks against authentication mechanisms on other network resources to which the attacker wishes to gain unauthorized access. For example, there have been cases where attackers have used parallel versions of traditional password cracking tools running on a compromised cluster in an attempt to decrypt stolen password files. Decrypting an encrypted password typically involves either a dictionary-type attack or a brute-force search through the entire space of possible passwords Because both of these are “embarrassingly parallel” problems, a cluster gives near linear speedup for the task, thus making the computational power of a cluster an attractive target to hackers.</p>
<p>(3)    Massive storage capacity – Many high-performance cluster environments include storage capacity measured in terabytes, used for storing large scientific datasets and the results produced by computations involving these datasets. To a hacker, large-capacity disk storage is an attractive target for use in creating repositories of stolen copyrighted software and multimedia files</p>
<p>The result of not treating cluster security as different from non-cluster security is an increased vulnerability to attacks that simultaneously target multiple cluster components.</p>
<p>Researchers at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign put forth the following features of a security approach that would be most successful in securing an HPC system.</p>
<p><b>Process monitoring</b> – Examining the individual processes running on each cluster node is critical for overall cluster security. Tools based on the Clumon monitoring framework  that collect information about every process on every node in a cluster, analyze the set of processes found, and visually alert the cluster administrator when anomalous conditions are discovered are important. Such anomalies might include system-related processes that should be running on a node but are in fact missing; processes that are running on a node when the node should be idle (particularly in the case of “root” processes); and an unusually-large number of processes running on an individual node or over the context of the entire cluster.</p>
<p>Detecting these types situations within a cluster is possible because a cluster presents a relatively limited search space for anomaly detection versus an enterprise network with machines of different types (servers, workstations, laptops) running an unbounded number of different software processes.</p>
<p><b>Network port scanning</b> – Unexpected network ports that are opened on a cluster node can be a good indicator of suspicious activity. A port scanner that monitors ports usage tailored to a cluster environment and presents the results to cluster administrators using visualization should be required. The underlying idea is that network ports must be opened in order for an attacker to interact with a cluster, otherwise compromising a cluster is of limited value since there can be little or no interaction with compromised nodes.</p>
<p><b>Traffic analysis</b> – Applications running on cluster systems have unique patterns of communication, making the task of distinguishing legitimate traffic from abnormal traffic difficult. This difficulty is compounded by the growing use of grid computing software that exhibit communication patterns that cross cluster boundaries by joining multiple geographically-distributed clusters into a single computational resource.</p>
<p>Correlation of the information from the cluster job scheduler with network traffic into and out of the cluster in order to distinguish typical cluster traffic patterns from suspicious or known malicious traffic patterns should be required. For example, an automated traffic analysis tool can use contextual information from the job manager as well as a constrained set of legitimate IP addresses belonging to one or more well-known clusters to aid in recognizing patterns of communication in parallel computations such as localized neighbor communication, many-to-many communication, or all-to-all communication.</p>
<p>That is, if a set of nodes are communicating with each other within the context of a single job, the traffic is most likely legitimate. This is in contrast to a machine on an enterprise network that is not attached to any unifying context. The ultimate goal is to automatically detect the types of traffic patterns.</p>
<p>In conclusion  to be effective, cluster security tools must monitor the state of the entire cluster, considering all facets of the cluster security problem and base decisions within this context.  And because of the performance requirements in high-performance distributed systems, it is not possible to simply retrofit existing security mechanisms and expect the HPC community to use them.</p>

      <title>Six security risks in High Performance Computing (HPC)</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>This is a two part blog. Today we’re going to talk about the risks many companies face in securing High Performance Computing (HPC) environments and then tomorrow we’ll talk about ways to properly secure such HPC systems.</p>
<p>Large-scale commodity cluster systems are finding increasing deployment in academic, research, and commercial settings. Coupled with this increasing popularity are concerns regarding the security of these clusters.</p>
<p>While a great deal of effort has been expended in creating tools to aid in the installation, administration, and monitoring of clusters, very little effort has been expended in creating tools that address the unique issues of cluster security, particularly for very large cluster installations</p>
<p>Many people believed that the issues related to cluster security were the same as for general computer security. (“What works for one system should work for a collection of 100 systems.”) However, as cluster systems have become more widespread and powerful, they have become increasingly desirable targets to attackers.</p>
<p>Researchers at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found six ways in which cluster security is different from traditional enterprise-level security. In order to be effective, cluster protection schemes must take these into account.</p>
<ol>
<li>A cluster encompasses a collection of distributed resources to be protected. By definition, clusters are multiple, closely-coupled machines that are centrally administered. These machines share common resources such as network access, compute cycles, and storage. The challenge is to secure these internal distributed resources against unauthorized access while at the same time permitting easy access by legitimate users. In contrast, the resources found in a typical enterprise-type environment are often very loosely coupled and exhibit minimal coherence of these types of resources.</li>
<li>A cluster must provide mechanisms for resource management. The challenge here is to manage a cluster such that legitimate users can consume resources efficiently in an authorized way using an agreed-upon job prioritization system. This is distinguished from enterprise-type environments that usually do not need to manage resources between competing interests. When a user executes a job on a cluster, it is often difficult to differentiate legitimate versus illegitimate use unless there are obvious malicious process signatures. For example, legitimate cluster users are potentially able to tamper with shared data or to excessively consume compute cycles to the extent of disrupting the service available to other cluster users.</li>
<li>Clusters present a heterogeneous management environment. That is, a cluster may be composed of different hardware and software node configurations (heterogeneous clusters). Even in the case of clusters containing the same hardware and software node configurations, there is usually a separation of cluster nodes by specialized function into “head nodes,” “compute nodes,” “storage nodes,” and “management nodes.” The challenge is to coordinate security across different node platforms and different specialized function nodes. This is different from enterprise-type security in that cluster security management must be simultaneously platform independent and specialized for different-functioning node types.</li>
<li>Clusters have large-scale management requirements. As Schneier points out, security is a process, not a product . As the sizes of clusters continue to increase, the task of maintaining and monitoring cluster security becomes an intractable problem. For example, one production cluster at NCSA consists of 1,500 nodes. At this scale, it is not practical to manage a cluster without leveraging the use of automation in conjunction with human interaction. Because of the heterogeneous management environment described above, tools to automate security management need to be aware of the similarities (and differences) present among cluster resources. In this way, cluster security is different from enterprise-level security because the tools that target enterprise-level security typically assume that every resource is subtly different.</li>
<li>Clusters, considered as a coherent unit, exhibit characteristic behavior different from non-clustered machines. This is exhibited in network traffic patterns, number of bytes transferred, applications executed, and compute loads. The challenge is first to identify, and later to understand, these behaviors via profiling in order to provide appropriate protections.</li>
<li>Finally, and perhaps most relevant to the idea that cluster security is an evolving concept, cluster resources exhibit dependent risk. In enterprise-level security, a single compromise on a machine may result in unauthorized access, destruction of data, and a platform for future attacks. However, a compromised machine in an enterprise can be quarantined to prevent cascading damages. In contrast, the security of the resources in a cluster environment is dependent on the integrity of all nodes. A single compromised node in a cluster represents a dramatically-increased risk to the rest of the cluster nodes due to the fact that many nodes share identical configurations. In this way, clusters are much more vulnerable to “class break” types of attacks. Experience also suggests that security failures in clusters are worse than enterprise-level failures due to the fact that cluster users tend to coordinate access across various geographically-distributed resources. This coordination necessitates crossing security domains, and when one of these security domains is compromised, the attacker has a much easier job of compromising the other security domains.</li>
</ol>

      <title>How to hack a corporate boardroom</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>One of the most important things we like to emphasize is that the greatest security flaws, the weakest link in the network chain, happens when you “don’t know what you don’t know.” Therefore a systematic approach to security process assessments should be par for the course in all organizations with significant assets.</p>
<p>A great testimony to this was found in the stories offered by a security firm which conducts penetration tests for clients with the goal of discovering IT security risks.</p>
<p>These penetration tests can discover security risks that are both potentially embarrassing and create huge risk for an organization. Such was the case when a penetration test was conducted for a large multi-national company.</p>
<p>The penetration test found 20 IP cameras that were at risk from an undocumented way to bypass the authentication system with the username: “root” and the password: “m”. Once the researchers had control of the IP cameras they were used to watch people enter information and discuss corporate activities.</p>
<p>Imagine being in a boardroom and you are being spied on without your knowledge? Discussions, keystrokes, passwords, strategic decisions, all potentially compromised.</p>
<p>One of the lessons learned was that typical automated network security scans would not have detected this potential exploit. A deeper review and analysis by security consultants identified areas of potential risk which were then tested and analyzed with available technology.</p>
<p>The security consultants approached this organization like a real criminal intent on breaching the walls of the firm, by any means necessary. And in the end found a hidden rat hole that was covered up.</p>
<p>So the moral of the story is two-fold. Don’t trust technology alone to secure your borders. This can create a false sense of security. And regular comprehensive assessments of your organizational security, like a corporate financial audit, is a good thing.</p>

      <title>Can technology detect fraud &amp; embezzlement</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>In the news this week was the story of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers employees that were indicted in a $20 million bribery and kickback scheme involving government contracts. Quick out the gate were vendors that talked about how their fraud prevention technology could have monitored and detected such scandalous behavior.</p>
<p>But is this true? To find out I took a little deeper dive in the area of fraud detection security solutions to see if they really work.</p>
<p>In general the answer is yes, for industries in which there are high volumes of transactions and available data to model typical consumer behavior and patterns.</p>
<p>For example, in the credit card, insurance claim, telecommunications, and banking industries we find successful application and results of deploying fraud detection solutions.</p>
<p>How they work is by modeling typical consumer behavior and looking for anomalies in transactions that differ from the norm. Then in cases where fraud has occurred, they analyze multiple variables associated with the crime and criminal to create predictive models that indicate the likelihood of a future crime in progress.</p>
<p>Fraud detection software has been used to stop millions in payments before they reached medical providers, who vary from the norm in claims submitted. It’s been used to spot fraudulent car insurance claims. A great example that one insurance provider in Germany reported is that claimants who call back shortly after filing a report and that demand a quick settlement are more likely to be cheaters.</p>
<p>Similar examples are found with credit card fraud. A consumer that buys gas using a credit card at a station where no attendant is present, or buys a diamond ring soon after buying gas has a higher fraud risk profile.</p>
<p>Purchase of two pairs of sneakers in teenage sizes  in London, New York or Miami during school holidays gets flagged as a high risk transaction, possibly involving a stolen credit card. A $100 purchase at a liquor store that sells whisky, a plane ticket outside of the country for a flight leaving in three hours and even a moped purchase by an elderly woman are various triggers based on scoring algorithms that alert companies to possible fraud.</p>
<p>In the case we cited above involving the kickback scheme, no fraud detection software was involved. Just someone who blew the  whistle on the crooks and good old police work. Some things technology will never replace.</p>

      <title>Security as a Service</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has published a series of guidelines to help  organizations in the area of security implementations. So I took a peek at their “Security as a Service” guidelines to see what they came up with.</p>
<p>Security as a Service refers to the provision of security applications and services via the cloud either to cloud-based infrastructure and software or from the cloud to the customers’ on-premise systems. It typically includes services such as third-party audits of cloud services or assessments of on-premise systems via cloud-provided solutions based on industry standards.</p>
<p>The CSA Security as a Service guidelines ended up being more of a checklist of things to review when shopping for providers. Nothing dramatically new here, but worth  sharing. Here are the guidelines:</p>
<p><b>Core Functionalities Needed</b></p>
<p>Governance — process by which policies are set and decision making is executed</p>
<p>Risk Management — process for ensuring that important business processes and behaviors remain within the tolerances associated with those policies and decisions</p>
<p>Compliance — process of adherence to policies and decisions. Policies can be derived from internal directives, procedures and requirements, or external laws, regulations, standards and agreements.</p>
<p>Technical Compliance Audits - automated auditing of configuration settings in devices, operating systems, databases, and applications.</p>
<p>Application Security Assessments - automated auditing of custom applications</p>
<p>Vulnerability Assessments - automated probing of network devices, computers and applications for known vulnerabilities and configuration issues</p>
<p>Penetration Testing - exploitation of vulnerabilities and configuration issues to gain access to a an environment, network or computer, typically requiring manual assistance</p>
<p>Security / risk rating - assessment of the overall security / vulnerability of the systems being tested, e.g. based on the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology</p>
<p><b>Threats Addressed</b></p>
<p>Inaccurate inventory</p>
<p>Lack of continuous monitoring</p>
<p>Lack of correlation information</p>
<p>Lack of complete auditing</p>
<p>Failure to meet/prove adherence to Regulatory/Standards Compliance</p>
<p>Insecure / vulnerable configurations</p>
<p>Insecure architectures</p>
<p>Insecure processes / processes not being followed</p>
<p><b>Optional Features</b></p>
<p>SI/EM Integration</p>
<p>Physical security assessments</p>
<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<p>Standards are on different maturity levels in the various sections</p>
<p>Certification &amp; Accreditation</p>
<p>Boundary definition for any assessments</p>
<p>Skills of tester(s) / assessors</p>
<p>Accuracy</p>
<p>Inconsistent ratings from different individuals / vendors</p>

	<p>Well the future is finally here. With your smartphone, you can board airplanes, order a latte at Starbucks, watch 3D movies and now dispense a Coke from a vending machine.</p>
<p>Google Wallet is a mobile application that aims to “turn your phone into your wallet.” It allows users of phones with near-field communications (NFC) hardware to pay for items using one of two virtual payment cards: a Citi MasterCard or a Google Prepaid Card, a card funded from a person's other credit cards.</p>
<p>The technology uses the PayPass contactless payment network familiar to many at Mobil gas stations. It requires a retailer or vending machine to have hardware that when “tapped” by a phone with NFC hardware will accept a wireless payment transfer from the customer’s account.</p>
<p>The capability initially will be available on the Samsung Nexus S 4G phone on Sprint's network. This smartphone payment application differs from the one available for Starbucks' customers. That application displays a barcode on the phone's screen. The customer then holds the phone in front of a scanner at the register, which reads the barcode and processes the sale against the customer’s prepaid Starbucks account.</p>
<p>Naturally, we were interested in the security for this uber mobile application.</p>
<p>First, the payment hardware (radio transmitter) in the phone is disabled when the user's phone is not active  - a state of automatic lockdown -and users have to ability to turn on or off the capability.</p>
<p>Next, the “Secure Element” chip which contains the users credit card or payment information is separated from the operating system and phone hardware, and its data is encrypted. Only authorized programs like Google Wallet can access the Secure Element to initiate a transaction.</p>
<p>Additionally, because Google Wallet enforces a security PIN, the only way to transmit payment credentials is if you first enter the security PIN. Entering your PIN temporarily enables the NFC chip and unlocks your card credentials so that they can be read by the vendor’s device.</p>
<p>The other potential risk would happen when your payments are wirelessly transferred from your phone to the PayPass reader ( a few inches away). We’ve already heard about hackers who intercept wireless transmissions with the potential to pick credit card numbers out of the air.</p>
<p>However, Google says MasterCard’s “secure encryption technology” will keep your data safe during its short, mid-air journey from phone to PayPass sensor.</p>
<p>I guess we have nothing to fear but fear itself. Might as well load up the smartphone and leave the wallet at home…for now.</p>

	<p>A recent McAfee report states that  only 22 percent of data center managers felt senior management is aware of their respective organization’s security measures and risk preparedness.</p>
<p>The key findings of the 2011 Data Center Security Survey, conducted by Gabriel Consulting Group (GCG) on behalf of McAfee, essentially says “management is ripe to be blindsided by a security breach” according to Dan Olds, Principal Analyst at GCG.</p>
<p>What compounds the problem is that many companies, according to the survey, use as many as seven vendors for their security in the data center. With so many cooks running around in the kitchen, visibility, cause and effect, and full security audits are often difficult.</p>
<p>There is a false sense of assurance with so many vendors and products when in reality more complexity introduces the opportunity for risk. Sounds like an argument for a more holistic approach to security process and preparedness assessment.</p>
<p>And in fact the report author foresees the same need: “customers will be looking for security solutions that solve multiple problems, are easily integrated, and reduce IT management and maintenance labor. To me, this argues <em>against</em> customers having a slate of different point products, all of which have to be configured to work together, all of which have different tools and consoles, all of which have varying levels of customer support. In this environment, customers will be more likely to look for multi-function solutions that provide great protection, but also reduce complexity and management.” <em>Dan Gold, GCG</em></p>
<p>Other interesting findings in the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>40% of the data centers surveyed said that their day-to-day operations don’t conform to the security standards required by their policies</li>
<li>60% said that management believes their data center is more secure than it really is</li>
<li>Respondents said that their management saw security as an expense item that doesn’t provide a financial return. As one respondent put it, “Security is only an issue to management when there is a problem – otherwise, it’s still a ‘why are we spending all this money’ question in budget meetings.”</li>
<li>Cost of security breaches. The biggest cost to the business side was additional money they had to spend for compliance and legal costs. On the IT side of the ledger, the biggest cost to the data center was lost productivity – with many breaches taking four weeks or more to remediate and almost half of the breaches using 50% or more of their IT resources (labor and time)</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the McAfee study reminds us of the similar conclusions reached by PwC in its annual Global Information Security Survey. In that report the bliss of ignorance was on mighty display. The report stated 43 percent of those surveyed believed their organizations qualified as "leaders" in how their security was implemented. When in fact less than 5 percent of the organizations actually qualified as "leaders."</p>

      <title>The conflict between internet security and customer satisfaction</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>In the early throes of this past summer season , we blogged about the hackfest at Sony and other major institutions. In these break-ins confidential consumer data was exposed or stolen. What we found was some companies made log-ins or access to account information easy for customers, in an effort to create a good consumer experience. However this wonderful endeavor also made the customer account more vulnerable to hackers.</p>
<p>Now we hear that researchers have discovered a serious weakness in virtually all websites that use the secure sockets layer protocol to prevent eavesdropping and tampering of communications across a network. According to the researchers, in their test labs they are able to decrypt data that's passing between a webserver and an end-user browser that supports versions 1.0 and earlier of TLS, or transport layer security, the successor to the secure sockets layer technology.</p>
<p>The problem is a fix is available, just upgrade the web browser and websites to versions 1.1 or 1.2 of TLS which aren't susceptible to this flaw. However versions 1.1 and 1.2 remain almost entirely unsupported in browsers and websites.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/10927/images/Qualys%20chart-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="describe the image"></p>
<p>Researches said upgrading TLS is proving surprisingly difficult, mostly because almost every fix breaks widely used applications or technologies.</p>
<p>Researchers Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo state: "Actually we have worked with browser and SSL vendors since early May, and every single proposed fix is incompatible with some existing SSL applications," Duong wrote. “What prevents people is that there are too many websites and browsers out there that support only SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0. If somebody switches his websites completely over to 1.1 or 1.2, he loses a significant part of his customers and vice versa.”</p>
<p>Herein is the dilemma, especially if you have a revenue producing website. Upgrade and patch known vulnerabilities and at the same time create incompatibilities with customer web browsers, and thus potentially lose customers.</p>
<p>Or continue business as is, with the known vulnerabilities, and chalk up any break-ins as the “cost of doing business.”</p>
<p>There is not an easy answer, but we do know human nature. And history shows many organizations will not improve security until forced by some catastrophic event, which is unfortunate.</p>

      <title>Lost trust in internet security authorities</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>These are uncertain times we live in. Economic turmoil, war, earthquakes, and typhoons. But when we lose trust in our authorities and lose confidence in things thought to be certain, our way of life can be disrupted.</p>
<p>At the end of August, attackers broke into DigiNotar, a SSL certificate authority and began issuing fake SSL certificates for multiple sites including Google. The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol was created to ensure secure transactions between web servers and browsers. This was to help end users (browsers) know they are dealing with the right or legitimate web site - to ensure that the web site owners are who they claim to be.</p>
<p>When it comes to trusting an SSL certificate, web browsers rely on authoritative certificate authorities like DigiNotar, that validate the authenticity of a given SSL certificate. Without a valid SSL certificate we can trust, users could be transacting with criminals posing as legitimate websites.</p>
<p>The failure of DigiNotar to effectively remove invalid SSL certificates, after the crime was discovered, endangered the public and confidence in digital transactions and communications. This failure led browser vendors, like Microsoft, to remove DigiNotar from the list of trusted certificate authorities.</p>
<p>"Microsoft has been able to confirm that one digital certificate affects all subdomains of google.com and may be used to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks against all Web browser users including users of Internet Explorer," Microsoft warned in an advisory. "As a precautionary measure, Microsoft has removed the DigiNotar root certificate from the Microsoft Certificate Trust List."</p>
<p>So when trust is lost in authorities, confidence is gone and the end of an establishment or organization can be the result. However, the other side of this story we shouldn’t miss is the resiliency of the ecosystem to rebound. The fraud was identified and remedial actions taken. So as with all things in life, the ride can get bumpy. But we shouldn’t lose confidence in the digital frontier as a way of life.</p>

      <title>How to protect your smartphone from hackers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>My oldest son recently got an Android powered, 1 GB 3D smartphone. Now why you want a 3D camera and viewing capabilities on a phone, is beyond me. But after he treated me to a free 3D movie and took my picture in 3D, I was smitten. Naturally it led me to investigate the security aspects of these smartphones which today are as powerful as any PC.</p>
<p>Smartphones are now outselling PCs, according to the latest research, but more ignominiously are the  increasing target of cybercriminals. People are using smartphones for an increasing number of activities and often store sensitive data such as email, calendars, contact information and passwords on the devices.</p>
<p>Mobile applications for social networking keep a wealth of personal information. Recent innovations in mobile commerce have enabled users to conduct many transactions from their smartphone, such as purchasing goods and applications over wireless networks, redeeming coupons and tickets, banking, processing point-of-sale payments, and even paying at cash registers.</p>
<p>Although mobile phones are taking on more capabilities formerly available only on PCs, technical security solutions for mobile phones are not as sophisticated or widespread as those for PCs. This means that the bulk of mobile phone security relies on the user making intelligent, cautious choices.</p>
<p>Even the most careful users can still fall victim to attacks on their mobile phones. However, following best practices, offered by US-CERT (Department of Homeland Security) regarding mobile phone security can reduce the likelihood or consequences of an attack.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>When choosing a mobile phone, consider its security features</b>. Ask the service provider if the device offers file encryption, the ability for the provider to find and wipe the device remotely, the ability to delete known malicious apps remotely, and authentication features such as device access passwords.</li>
<li>
<b>Configure the device to be more secure</b>. Many smartphones have a password feature that locks the device until the correct PIN or password is entered. Enable this feature, and choose a reasonably complex password. Enable encryption, remote wipe capabilities, and antivirus software if available.</li>
<li>
<b>Configure web accounts to use secure connections</b>. Accounts for certain websites can be configured to use secure, encrypted connections (look for “HTTPS” or “SSL” in account options pages). Enabling this feature deters attackers from eavesdropping on web sessions. Many popular mail and social networking sites include this option</li>
<li>
<b>Be choosy when selecting and installing apps</b>. Do a little research on apps before installing them. Check what permissions the app requires. If the permissions seem beyond what the app should require, do not install the app; it could be a Trojan horse, carrying malicious code in an attractive package.</li>
<li>
<b>Disable interfaces that are not currently in use</b>, such as Bluetooth, infrared, or Wi-Fi. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in software that use these interfaces</li>
<li>
<b>Set Bluetooth-enabled devices to non-discoverable</b>. When in discoverable mode, your Bluetooth-enabled devices are visible to other nearby devices, which may alert an attacker or infected device to target you. When in non-discoverable mode, your Bluetooth-enabled devices are invisible to other unauthenticated devices</li>
<li>
<b>Avoid joining unknown Wi-Fi networks and using public Wi-Fi hotspots</b>. Attackers can create phony Wi-Fi hotspots designed to attack mobile phones and may patrol public Wi-Fi networks for unsecured devices. Also, enable encryption on your home Wi-Fi network.</li>
<li>
<b>Do not “root” or “jailbreak” the device</b>. Third-party device firmware, which is sometimes used to get access to device features that are locked by default, can contain malicious code or unintentional security vulnerabilities. Altering the firmware could also prevent the device from receiving future operating system updates, which often contain valuable security updates and other feature upgrades</li>
<li>
<b>Delete all information stored in a device prior to discarding it</b>. Check the website of the device’s manufacturer for information about securely deleting data. Your mobile phone provider may also have useful information on securely wiping your device.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Humans the weakest link in cyber security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Details emerged last week about the notorious break-in at security firm RSA that resulted in the compromise of their SecureID two-factor authentication product and cost parent company EMC a reported $66 million.</p>
<p>What apparently happened is that an email was sent to a few EMC employees that had an Excel spreadsheet attached. eWeek.com reports that the “e-mail message had been spoofed to look like it had come from a generic Webmaster address at recruiting website Beyond.com, and had a subject line "2011 Recruitment plan." It had been sent to one EMC employee and copied to three others, possibly in the human resources department.”</p>
<p>The email was originally blocked and sent to the junk mail folder of the employees. However, the attached Excel spreadsheet was titled with a subject relevant to the job of one of the  recipients and therefore this employee retrieved the file from the junk mail folder, thinking the email was legitimate.</p>
<p>When the attached Excel file was opened an embedded Flash object was executed which then exploited Adobe's vulnerability to drop a Poison Ivy backdoor to the system. Poison Ivy back door* is a remote administration utility which bypasses normal security mechanisms to secretly control a program, computer or network.</p>
<p>The file was closed automatically, but it was too late as the computer was compromised. The malware then connected to a remote server, allowing the attacker full access to the infected workstation and all the user-accessible network drives. Attackers were able to move around the network until they found the critical data they were looking for.</p>
<p>As with many phishing attacks, we see the key to this break-in was an employee who went against normal protocol and opened up a file from an unsolicited source. The spam filter worked but the employee training on security scams failed – which is sad especially when you are a security firm.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether an email request is legitimate, try to verify it by contacting the company directly. Do not use contact information provided on a website connected to the request; instead, check previous statements for contact information.</p>
<p>Information about known phishing attacks is also available online from groups such as the Anti-Phishing Working Group (http://www.antiphishing.org).</p>
<p>*Backdoor:W32/PoisonIvy gives the attacker practically complete control over the infected computer. Exact functionality depends on the variant in question but the following are the most common operations available to the attacker (provided by F-Secure).</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can be renamed, deleted, or executed. Files can also be uploaded and downloaded to and from the system</li>
<li>The Windows registry can be viewed and edited</li>
<li>Currently running processes can be viewed and suspended or killed</li>
<li>Current network connections can be viewed and shut down</li>
<li>Services can be viewed and controlled (for example stopped or started)</li>
<li>Installed devices can be viewed and some devices can be disabled</li>
<li>The list of installed applications can be viewed and entries can be deleted or programs uninstalled</li>
<li>Other functionality includes viewing a list of open windows or starting a remote command shell on the infected computer</li>
<li>Poison Ivy variants can also steal information by taking screenshots of the desktop and recording audio or webcam footage.</li>
<li>They can also access saved passwords and password hashes. Some variants also have a keylogger.</li>
</ul>

	<p>"It took less than 24 hours to root BJM's server and copy all their data to our private servers," stated the hacker group Anonymous, regarding their break-in of law enforcement websites and theft of government agency data.</p>
<p>As we discussed in our last blog and reported by Cisco, root-kit enabled APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) are becoming the weapon of choice against governments, enterprises, mom-and-pop shops as well as national infrastructures.</p>
<p>What we want to focus on, however, is not the break-in but the response of the website administrators. What are the lessons to be learned? What could have been done to prevent or mitigate the damage in this situation?</p>
<p>The website operator in this case took the breached websites offline after the initial attack and tried to fix the problem by removing malware the hackers had placed on its sites. However, the company hadn’t removed all of the malware, which resulted in a second attack.</p>
<p>The hackers posted 10 GB of stolen data online, which contained confidential e-mails, passwords, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers. Apparently the IT administrator closed the security hole, but neglected to perform a full audit to check for other vulnerabilities or changes the attackers made. Therefore the malware remained undiscovered and allowed the hackers to re-compromise the system.</p>
<p>In fact, in the second attack a backdoor into the website’s online store was created which resulted in credit card numbers being stolen.</p>
<p>Lessons to be learned</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not enough to “fix” a problem, you have to continue to assess, remediate and report on security</li>
<li>Simply monitoring database access and regularly patching software could have thwarted many of the basic attacks</li>
<li>Data-centric encryption techniques should have been used to protect credit card data</li>
<li>Many organizations tend to fall behind in updating website plug-ins, making it a lucrative attack vector (e.g., blog software)</li>
<li>Attackers exploited an SQL-injection vulnerability on the site. In this kind of attack, database commands are entered inside a form, such as a forum post, comment box or even log-in box, and if the developers didn't enter proper error-handling methods in the code, the form would return data from the database server. There are several penetration testing tools available that automate the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws.</li>
<li>Passwords, in a similar attack, were not encrypted</li>
<li>Organizations must directly protect sensitive databases and not rely on perimeter defenses such as corporate firewalls and antivirus systems</li>
<li>It’s not enough to “fix” a problem, you have to continue to assess, remediate and report on security (in case you missed it the first time)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Advanced Persistent Threats source of major breaches</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Cisco recently released their “Cisco 2Q11 Global Threat Report” which provided data on the breaches and risks occurring across the world. For me, it reinforced the mantra that companies are suffering and putting themselves at risk because “they don’t know what they don’t know.”</p>
<p>Cisco states that advanced persistent threats (APTs) played a key role in many breaches. APTs are generally rootkit-enabled*, exhibit no visible symptoms of infection, and often employ escalation of privilege and other forms of exploit to traverse the compromised network. Malware used in this type of attack can bypass signature detection and other standard forms of security protection. As a result, APTs are seldom passively discovered; instead, active and ongoing analysis of in-house security data sources and traffic analysis is required.</p>
<p>In other words, standard security software for detection may not be much help. One must assume they have been infiltrated at some point and make continuous checks and forensic programs a part of daily security hygiene.</p>
<p>Gavin Reid, manager of the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) at Cisco, says “an organization’s ability to detect and respond to APTs can improve when well-understood computer security incident response capabilities are deployed.”</p>
<p>Some of these capabilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The capacity to produce, collect, and query logs—the more the better, but at least the important ones—from a security perspective (e.g., host logs, proxies, and authentication and attribution logs).</li>
<li>Some form of deep packet inspection that covers all the important “choke points” on your network.</li>
<li>The ability to quickly query network connections or flows across all network choke points.</li>
<li>Ongoing data analysis that can help you baseline what is normal for your enterprise, an important first step in readily identifying new or previously unseen incidents</li>
<li>Development of trust-based relationships with other organizations to share intelligence on events. For instance, join an organization like the Forum of Incident Response Teams (FIRST.org), which helps facilitate this type of information sharing.</li>
<li>Some degree of malware analysis (in-house or outside).</li>
</ul>
<p>On a final note, Reid adds, “If you have something of interest and you’re not seeing APT attacks in your organization, it is probably not that they are not occurring or that you’re safe. It’s more likely that you may need to rethink your detection capabilities.”</p>
<p>Make an effort to “know what you don’t know.”</p>
<p>*Rootkit is software that enables continued privileged access to a computer while actively hiding its presence from administrators by subverting standard operating system functionality or other applications. The real problem is an attacker being able to install a rootkit on a computer because he was able to obtain root-level access, either by exploiting a known vulnerability or, more likely, by obtaining a password (either by cracking the encryption, or through social engineering tactics)</p>

      <title>Top 8 hacker secrets revealed at DEF CON</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The DEF CON conference, a  meeting ground for hackers and those who want to learn what they are up to, was held last week in Vegas. There were some interesting topics and tips for cyber security I thought you might be interested in. So here is the abbreviated highlight reel.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are folks who make a living watching Internet traffic over wireless networks (like at Starbucks, McDonalds, etc.). In a demonstration at DEF CON it was easy to see unencrypted passwords and user names fly across the connection. Therefore, please consider  scrambling your Internet connection when using public Wi-FI networks. There are free services that provide this capability (if you scramble on one end you must descramble on the other so it not just something you put on your laptop).</li>
<li>In the same category, make sure you have strong passwords on ALL your mobile devices. Don't send passwords "in the clear," make sure they are encrypted.</li>
<li>Type in "https" instead of "http" in your browser bar. That puts you on a more secure version of many major websites. This works if you’re talking to web site that support SSL/TLS.</li>
<li>Credit cards that use quick-swipe technology (think Mobil Speedpass) can be read while they are still in your wallet by evil doers’. Someone with an RFID reader and a proper antenna in their backpack could swipe your credit card info by simply walking right by you.</li>
<li>Naughty hackers can install their own cell phone towers to intercept your calls (and text messages) before passing them on to the real mobile carrier. These "man-in-the-middle attacks," let hackers eavesdrop, but they can also alter your text messages, without your knowledge.</li>
<li>Don't accept USB devices as gifts unless you know the person very well.  It could be a Trojan Horse laden with malware to gain entry into your computer and company network.</li>
<li>Your hotel key card can be scanned by touch, so keep it deep in your wallet. Another common issue is the hotel key can get erased by other magnetic strip cards (credit cards) in your wallet or the other way around. In this case you may not want to put the key in your wallet at all.</li>
<li>Tavis Ormandy, who works as a researcher for Google, picked apart Sophos Antivirus software and found it lacking in several areas that leave it vulnerable to attack or circumvention - something he says might apply to other antivirus vendors' products as well, but he just hasn't looked.  He reverse engineered the product and found, among other things:  the key used to encrypt some data is stored with the data, making it relatively easy to decrypt; its buffer overflow protection only works on Windows platforms prior to Vista; the signatures Sophos selects to identify viruses are weak and can be generated independent of Sophos, making it possible to flood users with false positives.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, there were more than 8 “hacker secrets” but this was about as much as I could handle before running to make sure by credit card hadn’t been poached.</p>

      <title>Managing Federated Identities in the Cloud</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>I was visiting the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) website recently, during one of my downtimes. And they had a new update to their “Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing V2.1.” I was drawn to the section on federated identity management, a favorite topic of mine, especially during the summer months (don’t ask why).</p>
<p>Managing identities and access control for enterprise applications remains one of the greatest challenges facing IT today. While an enterprise may be able to leverage several Cloud Computing services without a good identity and access management strategy, in the long run extending an organization’s identity services into the cloud is a necessary precursor towards strategic use of on-demand computing services.</p>
<p>So here are the latest recommendations from CSA on federated identities in the Cloud:</p>
<p><b>CSA Federation Recommendations</b></p>
<p>In a Cloud Computing environment, federation of identity is key for enabling allied enterprises to authenticate, provide single or reduced Sign-On (SSO), and exchange identity attributes between the Service Provider (SP) and the Identity Provider (IdP). Organizations considering federated identity management in the cloud should understand the various challenges and possible solutions to address them with respect to identity lifecycle management, authentication methods, token formats, and non-repudiation.</p>
<p>(1) Enterprises looking for a cloud provider should verify that the provider supports at least one of the prominent standards (SAML and WS-Federation). SAML is emerging as a widely supported federation standard and is supported by major SaaS and PaaS cloud providers.</p>
<p>(2) Support for multiple standards enables a greater degree of flexibility. Cloud providers should have flexibility to accept the standard federation formats from different identity providers. However most cloud providers as of this writing support a single standard, e.g., SAML 1.1 or SAML 2.0. Cloud providers desiring to support multiple federation token formats should consider implementing some type of federation gateway.</p>
<p>(3) Organizations may wish to evaluate Federated Public SSO versus Federated Private SSO. Federated Public SSO is based on standards such as SAML and WS-Federation with the cloud provider, while Federated Private SSO leverages the existing SSO architecture over VPN. In the long run Federated Public SSO will be ideal, however an organization with a mature SSO architecture and limited number of cloud deployments may gain short-term cost benefits with a Federated Private SSO.</p>
<p>(4) Organizations may wish to opt for federation gateways in order to externalize their federation implementation, in order to manage the issuance and verification of tokens. Using this method, organizations delegate issuing various token types to the federation gateway, which then handles translating tokens from one format to another.</p>
<p>Well, these are the four recommendations from the CSA. Some things to think about during these hot summer days.</p>

      <title>Small firms with lax security targeted by hackers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The Wall Street Journal reported last Thursday that while the media focuses on hacking attacks at major firms like Sony, in actuality the majority of cybercrimes happen at firms with less than 100 employees.*</p>
<p>Most intriguing was the story of a magazine shop in which cyber crooks planted a software program on the cash register that sent customer credit-card numbers to Russia. It was illustrative of the situation facing many small firms that are computerizing  and digitizing records. With limited budgets and no technical staff they are extremely vulnerable to hackers.</p>
<p>The Journal  says Visa estimates about 95% of the credit card breaches it discovers are on its smallest business customers. And the situation will get worse because of lax security at many if not most of these firms. The Journal states that smaller companies are less likely to grasp the security threat and this was confirmed by a 2010 survey by the National Retail Federation and First Media Corp.</p>
<p>The survey found that 64% of small to medium sized retailers believed their businesses were not vulnerable to card data theft and only 49% had assessed their security safeguards. These folks were just ignorant of the impending danger in cyber space.</p>
<p>Reviewing the hack at the magazine shop, we find the following problems with this small business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowed remote Internet access (program called Remote Desktop) to computers that processed credit card point of sale transactions</li>
<li>Remote access program had a weak username and password (“POS”)</li>
<li>Hacker used same program, Remote Desktop, to gain access to point of sale computers (hacked password).</li>
<li>Hacker installed software that captured credit card information, before it was sent to the credit card processor.</li>
<li>Hacker software was detected and removed more than a year after it first gained access to business’ computers</li>
</ul>
<p>“Hacking at small businesses is  a prolific problem…It’s going to get much worse before it gets better.” Dean Kinsman, FBI, cyber division</p>
<p>So what can small businesses do to protect themselves?  First off we find small businesses neglect basic security measures such as changing default passwords. Their employees need to be trained about criminal tactics from phone calls to social media sites which aim to trick people in disclosing password access information. However, the fact there are many forms of security threats and the evolving nature of cyber crime makes it difficult to have a single list of dos and don’ts.</p>
<p>Which is why a holistic, continuous approach to assessment, people, policy, detection, deterrent, remediation and prosecution is the only way to go.</p>
<p>* Verizon/U.S. Secret Service study indicates in 2010 63% of cyber attacks at businesses with 100 or fewer employees.</p>

      <title>Top 3 dumb things that cause security failures</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Okay maybe dumb is a little harsh, but what we see time and again is that many network security breaches could have been prevented if companies knew what they didn’t know. Let me explain.</p>
<p><em>#1 Dumb Thing</em>– Many firms are unaware that critical IT systems have already been compromised. How can this be? The Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), a leading IT analyst, consulting, and research organization, in a recent study stated that many organizations incur security attacks but lack the right security skills and controls to know what to look for and where to look. In other words, someone is right in their back office pick pocketing them and they don’t even know it!</p>
<p class="Default"><em>#2 Dumb Thing</em> - Many cyber security problems are rooted in poorly written software. There are many vendors touting the latest intrusion detection, anti-hacker, malware repellent  pain relief, poison anti-dote security software. But the question is do they work and how effective are they? In the same ESG study 30% of organizations studied experienced a security incident directly related to the compromise of internally developed software.</p>
<p class="Default"><em>#3 Dumb Thing</em> – Organizations are sorely in bad shape - flabby, no discipline, out of shape, wimps when it comes to cyber security practices. Alarmingly, 20% of organizations categorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR) rated their organization’s security policies, procedures, and technology safeguards as “fair” or “poor.” Furthermore, 23% of organizations rate their executive management’s support for and investment in cyber security as “fair” or “poor.”</p>
<p class="Default">Time for a true look in the mirror</p>
<p class="Default">Sometimes the hardest thing for a person to do is to look in the mirror, accept their faults and take the first step towards change. It is the same for organizations. It may be time to assess where you are in staff level of skills, governance, oversight,  executive support, internal applications, network infrastructure as well as security solutions.</p>
<p class="Default">What is your true state? How are policy, people and technology working towards a common secure or unsecure environment? After this assessment then the process of creating a roadmap that will make your organization secure can occur. Think of it like a roadmap for securing your current and future investments.</p>

      <title>U.S. Critical Infrastructure Ripe for Attack</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), a leading IT analyst, consulting, and research organization, has conducted a research project to assess whether organizations categorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR) were vulnerable to security attacks due to weaknesses in cyber supply chain security.</p>
<p>Based on primary research with 285 U.S.-based CIKR organizations, ESG concludes that critical infrastructure firms realize they are under attack. ESG found that the vast majority of CIKR firms participating in the survey suffered at least one security breach over the past two years. Survey respondents believe that the current threat landscape is worse than it was two years ago and will grow even more insidious between 2010 and 2012. In spite of increasing security risks, ESG found abundant security vulnerabilities: about 20% of survey respondents don’t believe their organizations are prepared to meet today’s cyber security challenges.</p>
<p>In analyzing the data, ESG also found an ironic and somewhat frightening correlation: CIKR organizations with the best cyber security preparation, knowledge, and technology defenses were also the most likely to experience the highest number of security incidents. This introduces an important question: Are less secure organizations finding fewer security attacks because they aren’t occurring or because these organizations lack the skills, processes, and tools to know what to look for? The frightening implication here is that many CIKR organizations may already be compromised.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/10927/images/ESG-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="describe the image"></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Based on the research collected for this report, ESG concludes that: </span></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 5.3pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 5.3pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Cyber security protection is directly related to regulatory compliance</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. About one-third of the CIKR organizations surveyed are obligated to comply with more than three industry/government regulations. This group had consistently better security policies, procedures, and safeguards than those required to comply with less than three regulations</span></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 5.3pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Critical infrastructure organizations face constant cyberattacks. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Sixty-eight percent of CIKR organizations surveyed suffered at least one security breach over the past 24 months. Alarmingly, the organizations with the strongest security policies, procedures, and technical safeguards were also the ones with the highest number of security incidents. It is certainly possible that security-challenged CIKR organizations are under attack but lack the skills and tools to detect and remediate security incidents. </span></p>
<p class="Default"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Threats continue to escalate. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Twenty-eight percent of CIKR organizations believe that the threat landscape is much worse today than it was 24-36 months ago, while another 40% believe that the threat landscape is somewhat worse. Additionally, 71% of respondents believe that the threat landscape will be even worse two years from now. It is worth noting that CIKR organizations with the strongest security policies, procedures, and technical safeguards are the ones most likely to say that the threat landscape is getting much worse. </span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 5.3pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">IT vendor security audits are performed inconsistently and are rarely thorough.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> While most CIKR organizations are doing some IT vendor due diligence, ESG found that IT security audits are done haphazardly and lack real depth. </span></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 5.3pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In some cases, CIKR organizations conduct IT security audits that have little impact on IT procurement. To achieve best practices for IT vendor security audits, all vendors would need to be audited with standard audit procedures. The results of these IT security audits would then be a critical factor for ongoing IT procurement. Unfortunately, only 10% of CIKR follow these best practices for IT vendor audits. </span></p>
<p class="Default" style="margin-bottom: 5.3pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">External IT relationships lack appropriate security. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">To improve productivity, most CIKR organizations have opened internal IT systems to third parties like suppliers, customers, and business partners. While these relationships can help improve efficiency, increase revenue, and/or cut costs, they can also introduce cyber security vulnerabilities. </span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In aggregate, this research illustrates that many CIKR organizations are behind with <em>basic </em>security protection, let alone more advanced cyber supply chain security defenses. Many lack the skills or resources, while others need guidance and help with establishing best practices. There is also a visible cyber security communications gap between grass roots security professionals and executive managers who either don’t understand or don’t care about escalating cyber security risks. ESG believes that this situation leaves the U.S. critical infrastructure vulnerable to a cyberattack. </span></p>

      <title>Insider security threats could be on the rise</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The U.S. Government released a cybersecurity legislative proposal for Congress to consider in light of the increased need for critical infrastructure security. The proposal features the following main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Data Breach Reporting</li>
<li>Penalties for Computer Criminals</li>
<li>Voluntary Government Assistance to Industry, States, and Local Government. Organizations that suffer a cyber intrusion</li>
<li>Voluntary Information Sharing with Industry, States, and Local Government</li>
<li>Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Plans</li>
<li>Update the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and formalize DHS’ current role in managing cybersecurity for the Federal Government’s civilian computers and networks</li>
<li>The recruitment and retention of highly-qualified cybersecurity professionals</li>
<li>Intrusion Prevention Systems</li>
<li>Cloud computing</li>
<li>A new framework of privacy and civil liberties protection designed expressly to address the challenges of cybersecurity</li>
</ul>
<p>While laudable and the right thing to do, some critics say the White House cybersecurity proposal could actually make networks more vulnerable by opening them to new insider threats.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, covered companies would be responsible for mitigating threats, but third-party inspectors would assess their control over those risks regularly.</p>
<p>"The single largest vulnerability of our cyber systems comes not from hackers using technology to break into systems, but from insiders with approved access to the systems," Larry Clinton, president of the Internet Security Alliance, which represents industries with a stake in online security, told House members at a Homeland Security Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies subcommittee hearing. "This proposal creates a virtual army of insiders crawling through our most critical infrastructure's security systems on an annual basis."</p>
<p>Clinton suggested replacing audits with cyber insurance that would provide businesses an economic incentive to heighten protections on their own. Committee members seemed to agree with the concept.</p>
<p>"The best way to do it is to make the system so that the organizations want to invest in security, so that they see it in their own self interest," Clinton added. "My daughter drives more carefully because she wants a good driver discount," he said in providing an example of the financial incentive companies would have to practice good cyber hygiene.</p>
<p>The White House proposal includes several financial bonuses and economic punishments but does not address insurance. Companies that fail their annual security tests would be named publicly, which could damage their brands or upset investors, administration officials said recently. Also, firms that perform well might be eligible for more government business.</p>
<p>It is an interesting concept, providing financial incentives for companies to do what is in their best interests. Yet what we have learned from the food industry and other industries where government inspections are mandated, is  human nature is often complacent, seeks to cut corners, seeks to save money, and to gain an advantage even at the expense of others. Which has resulted in the need for government oversight in critical areas such as auto inspections – which may be a great model for this proposal.</p>
<p>Therefore I think there will be a middle ground, where there are incentives for companies to do the right thing in terms of bolstering security, yet the availability of outside security firms to test and upgrade cyber defenses.</p>

      <title>Lessons learned from Citigroup hack</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Recently  Citigroup announced that hackers had breached its systems in May and accessed personal data from 200,000 accounts — about 1% of its customers. The hackers managed to steal customer email addresses, contact information and account numbers.</p>
<p>However, what is alarming is not that Citigroup was hacked, it was the ease in which the hackers penetrated Citi’s security mechanisms by simply altering the bank's URL.</p>
<p>When users log into the Citi Account Online system the URL changes to include a series of numbers relevant to the user's account. However, it was discovered that someone could access another's account by simply changing those numbers, according to The New York Times.</p>
<p>The cyber criminals used this very simple technique to jump from account to account. They also developed a script to automate the attack. What is astounding is that at such a large financial institution there was no security review or risk assessment to catch this obvious flaw in their consumer security systems.</p>
<p>No technical knowledge would have been required for any average Joe to simply change numbers in the URL and access someone else’s account. There wasn’t even a  trip mechanism that forced the user to log-in again.</p>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, the nation's primary regulator, is preparing new measures on data security. Its chairman Sheila Bair said she may ask "some banks to strengthen their authentication when a customer logs onto online accounts.”</p>
<p>Whoa! Sounds like a decent recommendation. But why do we need a calamity before, at a very basic minimum, instituting fundamental reviews of security systems? Now that your bank has been hacked, what should a consumer do? Here are some recommended steps from Identity Theft 911's Ondrej Krehel:</p>
<p>No. 1: Look at your financial statements. Check your account online and see if your credit card has been used without your authorization</p>
<p>No. 2: Reset passwords. Citigroup may have already reset passwords for those who have been affected, he said, but as a precaution you should change your passwords for online accounts.</p>
<p>No. 3: Be wary. In the wake of a breach be suspicious of correspondence with financial companies.</p>
<p>No. 4: Consider unique passwords. Don't use the same passwords for all of your accounts</p>
<p>No. 5: Change your security questions</p>
<p>No. 6: Update your security programs. Make sure all of your antivirus protection software is up-to-date</p>

      <title>13 key metrics for assessing your network security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Cyber Security Division, issued the FY 2011 CIO FISMA Reporting guidelines which require agencies to report on their progress in automating the continuous measurement of their most critical security risks.</p>
<p>The idea is that you can only improve what you can measure. And by requiring agencies to comply with standard guidelines, overall security can be improved.</p>
<p>The new metrics cover 13 areas that include system inventory, asset management, configuration management, vulnerability management, identity and access management, data protection, boundary protection, incident management, training and education, remote access, network security protocols, software assurance and continuous monitoring.</p>
<p>Some of the detail reporting requirements include the number of agency and contractor operated systems categorized at high, moderate or low impact levels for a security breach; individual assets including laptops and personal mobile devices as well as routers in the network and their ability to encrypt data.</p>
<p>Agencies also are to report on their ability to remotely detect and block unauthorized software on the network, including their capability to use the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database.</p>
<p>President Obama’s White House blog in May is consistent with this latest policy update in that he states:</p>
<p>“We count on computer networks to deliver our oil and gas, our power and our water. We rely on them for public transportation and air traffic control… But just as we failed in the past to invest in our physical infrastructure – our roads, our bridges and rails – we've failed to invest in the security of our digital infrastructure… This status quo is no longer acceptable – not when there's so much at stake. We can and we must do better. – President Obama”</p>

      <title>Obama’s International Strategy for Cyberspace</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>“This world—cyberspace—is a world that we depend on every single day... [it] has made us more interconnected than at any time in human history.” —President Barack Obama, May 29, 2009</p>
<p>The White House released a white paper last month on the U.S. strategy and policy regarding the future of the Internet and the implications of an increasing online world. I decided to explore this 30 page paper from the perspective of cybersecurity, to see what was on the mind of our President and where he saw the world and the U.S. in particular heading.</p>
<p>President Obama in his own words “envisions a future in which reliable access to the Internet is available from nearly any point on the globe, at a price that businesses and families can afford. Computers can communicate with one another across a seamless landscape of global networks permitting trusted, instantaneous communication with friends and colleagues down the block or around the world. Content is offered in local languages and flows freely beyond national borders, as improvements in digital translation open to millions a wealth of knowledge, new ideas, and rich debates. New technologies improving agriculture or promoting public health are shared with those in greatest need, and difficult problems benefit from global collaboration among experts and innovators. This, in part, is the future of cyberspace that the United States seeks—and the future we will work to realize.”</p>
<p>Ok I am with the President so far. Next, specifically focusing on cybersecurity incidents, the U.S. aims to detect threats early and share data in real-time to mitigate the spread of malware or minimize the impact of a major disruption—all while preserving the broader free flow of information.</p>
<p>Makes sense and stuff we’ve heard before.</p>
<p>The President then states “The United States will defend its networks, whether the threat comes from terrorists, cybercriminals, or states and their proxies. Just as importantly, we will seek to encourage good actors and dissuade and deter those who threaten peace and stability through actions in cyberspace. We will do so with overlapping policies that combine national and international network resilience with vigilance and a range of credible response options. In all our defense endeavors, we will protect civil liberties and privacy in accordance with our laws and principles.”</p>
<p>Ok we are going to carry a big club and be careful not to clobber the wrong people. I’m with you all the way Mr. President.</p>
<p>“In the case of criminals and other non-state actors who would threaten our national and economic security, domestic deterrence requires all states have processes that permit them to investigate, apprehend, and prosecute those who intrude or disrupt networks at home or abroad. Internationally, law enforcement organizations must work in concert with one another whenever possible to freeze perishable data vital to ongoing investigations, to work with legislatures and justice ministries to harmonize their approaches, and to promote due process and the rule of law—all key tenets of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.”</p>
<p>“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military, and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests. In so doing, we will exhaust all options before military force whenever we can; will carefully weigh the costs and risks of action against the costs of inaction; and will act in a way that reflects our values and strengthens our legitimacy, seeking broad international support whenever possible.”</p>
<p>To paraphrase, if we need to the U.S. will launch some missiles to dislodge that nasty botnet server – with international support for our actions of course.  All in all, the President is highlighting the fact that we are deep into the digital age and getting even deeper as technology becomes ingrained in our way of life. And thus, the U.S. will do everything in its power to build, maintain, and protect this way of life going forward.  I can dig it.</p>

      <title>Judgment Day for Sony Brings Hackfest</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Judgment Day was in the all the news recently since the world as we know it was supposed to end on May 21, 2011. When it didn’t I’m sure Sony wished it had as the company continues to suffer a brutal hackfest around the world.</p>
<p>At least 11 breaches have occurred in the last six weeks at Sony companies. Lets’ recap some of the carnage in just April and May 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li>April 4th: Several Sony websites go down amid denial of service attacks </li>
<li>April 26th: After a PlayStation Network outage of more than a week, Sony reveals that malicious hackers have gained access to 77 million users accounts</li>
<li>May 3rd: Sony reveals that in the days before the PSN breach, hackers compromised another 24.6 million users’ records on the Sony Online Entertainment network</li>
<li>May 5th: Intruders stole the names and e-mail addresses of about 2,000 customers at Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB’s Canadian website</li>
<li>May 18th: An unidentified source digs up a vulnerability in Sony’s password reset page, which allows anyone to change a user’s password using only his or her email address and date of birth</li>
<li>May 20th: Sony is hit on the same day with a hack of its Internet service provider and news of a phishing site hosted on its Thai website</li>
</ul>
<p>In underground online forums last week, hackers said Sony’s servers were severely outdated and infiltrating them was relatively easy.  Eugene Spafford, a security expert and professor at Purdue University, told a House subcommittee that computer security experts had been aware for months that the PlayStation’s Web servers were outdated and that the company’s network lacked sufficient security — which he said Sony must have also known.</p>
<p>The new intrusions indicate Sony is failing to contain the situation,  and cybercriminals are being attracted to them like sharks sensing fresh blood. So what can Sony do?</p>
<p>The first question I have is were external risk assessments and penetration testing of these sites conducted? Sony’s response has been to move to new data centers and add more encryption and firewalls. But is that enough? We’ll have to wait and see. Until the next Judgment Day.</p>

      <title>Security lapses risk privacy of healthcare records</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>In a recently released government report, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) found that the group (ONC) within HHS responsible for the infrastructure of the electronic healthcare records systems, failed to implement general IT security controls.</p>
<p>The report entitled “Audit of Information Technology Security Included in Health Information Technology Standards (A-18-09-30160),” states  general IT security controls emphasized by the Office of Management and Budget and the National Institute of Standards and Technology but not addressed by ONC are:</p>
<p>• encrypting data stored on mobile devices, such as compact disks and thumb drives;</p>
<p>• requiring two-factor authentication when remotely accessing an HIT system; and</p>
<p>• patching the operating systems of computer systems that process and store EHR</p>
<p>“We found the lack of these and other general IT security controls during prior Office of Inspector General audits at Medicare contractors, State Medicaid agencies, and hospitals. The vulnerabilities that we noted, combined with our findings in this audit, raise concern about the effectiveness of IT security for HIT (health information technology) if general IT security controls are not addressed.”</p>
<p>This is a little disconcerting given the push towards full electronic disposition of personal healthcare records. ONC  (Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology) did respond to the audit report by stating “it relies on the HIPAA Security Rule to ensure that appropriate IT security controls are in place.”</p>
<p>However, the OIG wasn’t convinced as their “concern with the effectiveness of the HIPAA Security Rule is based on work that we did on CMS’s oversight of covered entity compliance with HIPAA and the significant weaknesses we found in IT security at eight hospitals.”  Examples of the weaknesses identified at the eight hospitals included:</p>
<p>• unprotected wireless networks,</p>
<p>• lack of vendor support for OSs,</p>
<p>• inadequate system patching,</p>
<p>• outdated or missing antivirus software,</p>
<p>• lack of encryption of data on portable devices and media,</p>
<p>• lack of system event logging or review,</p>
<p>• shared user accounts, and</p>
<p>• excessive user access and administrative rights.</p>
<p>And therefore the OIG states their “experience with HIPAA implementation in hospitals does not support ONC’s position that HIPAA provides adequate general IT security.”</p>
<p><strong> Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In the end the OIG recommended that ONC:</p>
<p>• broaden its focus from interoperability specifications to include well-developed general IT security controls for supporting systems, networks, and infrastructures;</p>
<p>• use its leadership role to provide guidance to the health industry on established general IT security standards and IT industry security best practices;</p>
<p>• emphasize to the medical community the importance of general IT security; and</p>
<p>• coordinate its work with CMS and OCR to add general IT security controls where applicable.</p>
<p>There is hope at the end of the tunnel.</p>

      <title>Telework Act of 2010: Model for Secure Telecommuting</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 enables and authorizes government agencies to allow workers to work from home. Motivated by the effect of severe snow storms and  blizzards that shut down the federal government last year, President Obama and his administration wanted a solution that would allow the federal government to continue operating, even during inclement weather, natural disasters or other emergencies.</p>
<p>The key requirements of the of the Telework Act  provide policy guidelines I think will be useful for all enterprises considering officially sanctioned telework (also called telecommuting) policies.</p>
<p>The head of each executive agency is required to:</p>
<ul>
<li>establish a policy under which eligible agency employees may be authorized to telework; (2) determine employee eligibility to participate in telework; and (3) notify all employees of their eligibility to telework</li>
<li>ensure that telework does not diminish employee performance or agency operations</li>
<li>provide that an employee may not be authorized to telework if that employee's performance does not comply with the terms of the agreement</li>
<li>prohibit from telework any agency employee whose official duties require, on a daily basis, direct handling of secure materials determined to be inappropriate for telework or on-site activity that cannot be handled remotely or at an alternate worksite </li>
<li>prohibit participation in telework by an employee who has been officially disciplined for being absent without permission for more than five days in any calendar year or for viewing, downloading, or exchanging pornography on a government computer or while performing official government duties</li>
<li>ensure that telework policy is created that covers areas including <strong>c</strong>ontinuation of operations, telework centers, technology, equipment, dependent care, and records management</li>
<li>issue guidelines to ensure the adequacy of information and security protections for information and information systems used while teleworking</li>
<li>maintain a central telework website that includes telework links, announcements, and guidance </li>
<li>pay necessary travel expenses for employees participating in a telework program in lieu of otherwise authorized travel or transportation expenses </li>
<li>evaluate and document cost savings or other efficiencies for the government provided through the telework program </li>
<li>research the utilization of telework by public and private sector entities that identify best practices and recommendations </li>
<li>review the outcomes associated with an increase in telework, including the effects of telework on energy consumption, job creation and availability, urban transportation patterns, and the ability to anticipate the dispersal of work during periods of emergency</li>
</ul>

      <title>How to eavesdrop on Internet phone calls</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Motivated by the need to use less bandwidth, some service providers for Internet phone calls use a compression technique called variable bitrate compression. The technique produces different size packets of data for different sounds.</p>
<p>How it works is the sampling rate is kept high for long complex sounds like "ow," but cut down for simple consonants like "c." This variable method saves on bandwidth, while maintaining sound quality.</p>
<p>Since VoIP calls may traverse untrusted networks, packets should be encrypted to ensure confidentiality. However, although Voice over IP (VoIP) is rapidly being adopted, its security implications are not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>Now comes a report from  researchers at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Google, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill  and John Hopkins University stating it is possible to identify the phrases spoken within encrypted VoIP calls when the audio is encoded using variable bit rate codecs.</p>
<p>Wow! This means VoIP services like Skype and Vonage which use variable bit rate compression (the compression rate varies according to the actual words being spoken) could be vulnerable to such an attack.</p>
<p><strong>How they did it</strong></p>
<p>The researchers trained a hidden Markov model using only knowledge of the phonetic pronunciations of words, such as those provided by a dictionary, and searched packet sequences for instances of specified phrases. The  approach did not require examples of the speaker’s voice, or even example recordings of the words that make up the target phrase.</p>
<p>They evaluated their techniques on a standard speech recognition corpus containing over 2,000 phonetically rich phrases spoken by 630 distinct speakers from across the continental United States. The results indicated they could identify phrases within encrypted calls with an average accuracy of 50%; and with accuracy greater than 90% for some phrases.</p>
<p>Clearly, such an attack calls into question the efficacy of current VoIP encryption standards.  However, there is a potential solution if VoIP providers expanded the data packets to an equal length. The downside is this approach would reduce the extent of the compression and hence use more bandwidth.</p>
<p>There is always a cost to security: you can pay now or you can pay later, but it will cost.</p>

      <title>Sony PlayStation Hack: biggest security breach in history</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>77 million video gamers’ account data, including names, birth dates, email addresses and log-ins, were compromised after a cyberattack on a Sony datacenter in San Diego, California. The datacenter was home for the Sony PlayStation Network -- which allows users to play games with friends around the world and download movies and games over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sony officials have stated, “the entire credit card table was encrypted and we have no evidence that credit card data was taken. The personal data table, which is a separate data set, was not encrypted, but was behind a very sophisticated security system that was breached in a malicious attack.”</p>
<p>However, combined with other data, the personal data table is valuable. Since most people use the same passwords across various online websites, a cybercriminal could use the passwords to unlock everything from Facebook accounts to online banking. The e-mail addresses could be used in phishing attacks, with the fraudster using stolen details — like the target’s date-of-birth — to increase the chances of a response.</p>
<p>A saving grace for Sony is that since the credit card numbers were encrypted it might help them argue they were in compliance with the official Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, which mandates encryption for stored credit card data — something that could help Sony in the class actions lawsuits that have already begun.</p>
<p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>
<p>In its FAQ, Sony said, “If you use the same user name or password for your PlayStation Network or Qriocity service account for other unrelated services or accounts, we strongly that you change them.”</p>
<p>However, there is currently no way a user can find out what password he or she was using for PlayStation Network if it’s been forgotten, Sony told the website Giant Bomb.</p>
<p>“For your security, we encourage you to be especially aware of e-mail, telephone, postal mail or other scams that ask for personal or sensitive information,” the company said in an Update on PSN Service Outages FAQ posted Tuesday. “Sony will not contact you in any way, including by e-mail, asking for your credit card number, Social Security number or other personally identifiable information. If you are asked for this information, you can be confident Sony is not the entity asking.”</p>
<p>As we look at the weaknesses in the digital economy, perhaps consumers should  also consider not using a checking account debit card for online transactions. Keep a separate credit card, just for online use that can limit your liability in case it is stolen and help in figuring out if you were the victim of a cybercrime.</p>

	<p>The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) initiated an audit of the IRS because the IRS relaxed its long-standing internal policy prohibiting employees from transmitting Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) data to taxpayers in emails.</p>
<p>The objective of the review was to determine whether IRS controls, policies, and procedures for sensitive email messages to taxpayers adequately protected taxpayers’ data, guarded against email threats to the IRS network, and ensured email practices were compliant with Federal regulations.</p>
<p><strong>What they found</strong></p>
<p>Although some controls for the Secure Email With Taxpayers program are in place, such as the installation of antivirus software on employees’ computers, other security controls were not implemented.</p>
<p>The IRS has not implemented an automated control to detect and prevent SBU data in unencrypted emails from being transmitted outside the IRS. In addition, some employees and taxpayers are not encrypting their emails that contain SBU data.</p>
<p>These violations of the program were not reported to IRS management. Furthermore, IRS procedures and training lacks adequate guidance for employees to report the violations. In addition, the IRS does not timely correct persistent medium-risk security vulnerabilities detected on email servers, the audit reported.</p>
<p><strong>What TIGTA recommended </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TIGTA recommended that the Large Business and International Division and Office of Appeals coordinate with the Office of Privacy, Information Protection, and Data Security to develop additional procedures for employees participating in the Secure Email With Taxpayers program to address how, when, and to whom employee and taxpayer secure email violations should be reported </li>
<li>Update guides and training materials to include these procedures</li>
<li>Amend the Memorandum of Understanding to apprise the taxpayer of the specific risks associated with transmitting unencrypted email with SBU data</li>
<li>Issue a memorandum to all employees advising them of the disciplinary actions that will be taken against employees who violate IRS email policies by sending unencrypted emails to taxpayers who have not signed a Memorandum of Understanding to participate in the program </li>
</ul>
<p>TIGTA also recommended that the Associate Chief Information Officer, Cybersecurity, ensure data leakage prevention software is implemented by April 2012, and update the annual Information Systems Security briefing to include the new Secure Email With Taxpayers procedures.</p>
<p>Lastly, TIGTA recommended the Associate Chief Information Officer, Enterprise Operations, ensure medium-risk vulnerabilities detected on email servers are appropriately tracked and, if the vulnerabilities cannot be corrected within two months, follow security requirements to post the vulnerabilities to the appropriate Plan of Actions and Milestones.</p>
<p>In their response to the report, IRS officials agreed with six of the recommendations and partially agreed with three. For the three partially agreed recommendations, TIGTA continues to believe that the IRS should fully implement the recommendations.</p>
<p>A technology system that can monitor for insecure emails could prevent these types of violations. But the IRS will not be able to install such a tool until July 2012. Until then, "the IRS cannot stop these types of emails from occurring other than by relying on employee compliance," wrote Michael R. Phillips, deputy inspector general for audit at TIGTA. "</p>

      <title>Zero Day Security Advisories: Caveat Emptor</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Microsoft and Adobe have led the charge in 2011 in releasing security advisories warning of potential Zero Day vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>On yesterday’s “Patch Tuesday” Microsoft had an overwhelming 17 security bulletins (nine of which have been given Microsoft's highest severity rating of "critical"), addressing 64 security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>One of the vulnerabilities reportedly fixed will be the MHTML rendering flaw that was discovered earlier this year. Internet Explorer was one the products found to be at risk from the zero-day vulnerability that could allow maliciously crafted webpages to execute code in any "zone" regardless of which zone is specified.</p>
<p>Any applications that use Microsoft's HTML renderer can be attacked including Internet Explorer, but applications that always open web content in the "Restricted zone" are not affected including Outlook, Outlook Express, and Windows Mail.</p>
<p>For individuals, or people who only manage a small number of computers, Microsoft has provided a “Fix it tool” that allows users to apply their recommended settings without having to use GPOs or having to manually edit registry keys.</p>
<p>Adobe Systems Inc. has also issued a security advisory notifying users of a serious Flash Player zero-day exploit that could be used by attackers to gain complete control of a system.  </p>
<p>A critical vulnerability exists in Flash Player 10.2.153.1 and earlier versions (Adobe Flash Player 10.2.154.25 and earlier for Chrome users) for Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Solaris, Adobe Flash Player 10.2.156.12 and earlier versions for Android, and the Authplay.dll component that ships with Adobe Reader and Acrobat X (10.0.2) and earlier 10.x and 9.x versions for Windows and Macintosh operating systems.</p>
<p>This vulnerability (CVE-2011-0611) could cause a crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system. There are reports that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild in targeted attacks via a Flash (.swf) file embedded in a Microsoft Word (.doc) file delivered as an email attachment, targeting the Windows platform.</p>
<p>At this time, Adobe is not aware of any attacks via PDF targeting Adobe Reader and Acrobat. Adobe Reader X Protected Mode mitigations would prevent an exploit of this kind from executing.</p>
<p>it seems to be only a matter of time before we see criminals trying to exploit these flaws, so keep your systems up to date!</p>

      <title>The iPad in the workplace: is it secure?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The Wall Street Journal  reported that 65 percent of the Fortune 100 have either deployed or have pilots running with the iPad. Meanwhile, Network World puts the number in the Fortune 100 as 80 percent.</p>
<p>The iPad has great strengths in the areas of electronic media consumption and sharing of content. It makes rich content and consumer applications usable both at home and away.</p>
<p>Originally targeted towards the consumer market and not the enterprise, the question arises, is the iPad safe to use in a security-sensitive corporate environment?</p>
<p>In the workplace we observe the iPad being used to access complex applications that host customer, patient, sales, product, logistics, and order information. Good Technology, which provides tools for IT to manage mobile environments, published this chart of industry deployments of the iPad in Q4 2010.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/10927/images/iPad%20in%20industry-resized-600.jpg" border="0" alt="iPad in industry resized 600"></p>
<p><em> The good</em></p>
<p>Many IT managers like the increased security that comes with the iPad’s operating system, iOS4, especially the application level encryption. This capability encrypts the content of each application's data with a unique key, separating out each application's data on the device. So when you need to access your CRM application while sipping on a latte at Starbucks, the iPad's built-in encryption makes these communications as secure as those from laptops or desktops. In addition encryption is built into the hardware, making it easy to erase all data if your iPad is lost or stolen.  </p>
<p>The iPad OS, iOS 4 also allows enterprises to impose security policies on their mobile devices. These include setting a password lock, requiring a device to automatically erase company data after a certain number of failed logins, blocking camera access, or locking down the device to prevent users from installing unauthorized applications.</p>
<p>In addition to enabling secure access to existing VPN environments, iPad offers proven methods for user authentication. Authentication via standard x.509 digital certificates provides users with streamlined access to company resources and a viable alternative to using hardware-based tokens. Additionally, certificate authentication enables iPad to take advantage of VPN On Demand, making the VPN authentication process transparent while still providing strong, credentialed access to network services.</p>
<p><em>The ugly</em></p>
<p>If you have NSA-level, top secret applications that require separate levels of biometric authentication, the iPad isn’t the tablet of choice. Also while iPad e-mail can be funneled through a company network - with all the monitoring, archiving and auditing already built into the enterprise gateways - text messages go out over less secure telephone networks.</p>
<p>“To keep customer data safe, experts say, enterprises should encrypt all sensitive communications in and out of the device, encrypt customer data and important documents that are stored on the device itself, use the strongest practical authentication mechanisms, and opt for cloud delivery of content rather than local storage, when available.”</p>
<p>The iPad is here to stay, so it means security professionals will have to figure out how to make it and other “consumer” devices work in the enterprise. Especially when the CEO shows up at work toting one under his arm.</p>

      <title>After RSA hack security left to customers</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>You’ve probably heard by now about the break-in at security firm RSA, a division of EMC.  The hackers penetrated the servers of RSA and stole information about its RSA SecurID two-factor authentication tokens. The tokens are used for authentication by 40 million end users to access highly confidential corporate and government networks.</p>
<p>“Whoever attacked RSA has certain information” about the product, “but not enough to complete a successful attack without obtaining additional information that is only held by our customers,” the company said.</p>
<p>To compromise a SecurID deployment an attacker would need information about the token, the corporate customer, the individual user and the user’s PIN, the company said.</p>
<p>The attack was in the category of an Advanced Persistent Threat or APT. This means the attack could have been ongoing for days, weeks, or months. APTs are a broad class of computer attacks that typically use sophisticated and often multiple exploits to quietly breach system defenses. The goal of such an attack usually is not to disrupt the system’s operations, but to remain hidden and quietly gather information, such as proprietary source code, for as long as possible without attracting attention.</p>
<p>In light of the compromise to their security products, RSA is urging customers to follow a variety of security best-practices. These include: “enforce strong password and pin policies,” “re-educate employees on the importance of avoiding suspicious emails,” and to “harden, closely monitor, and limit remote and physical access to infrastructure that is hosting critical security software.”</p>
<p>RSA further advised customers to lock down SecurID Authentication Manager databases, review recent logs for unusually high rates of failed authentication attempts, establish strong PIN and lockout policies, and educate help desks and users about avoiding social engineering attempts to gain information.</p>
<p>In addition, clients of RSA might consider requiring their employees to have physical access (on premise) to the network to validate their identity, in case the criminals may have intercepted the users' password.</p>
<p>The moral of the story here is if you continue to follow security best practices, with regular security audits and training, then you can mitigate even the worse type of attacks.</p>

      <title>Don’t be Googled: Encrypt your Wi-Fi</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>We blogged a few months back about the dangers of using un-encrypted Wi-Fi networks. How cyber criminals could snoop and capture information in your emails or other data you are transmitting. Well the French  government just fined Google  for unfair data collection from wireless networks through the company's Street View mapping service and localization program Latitude.</p>
<p>The data captured included technical data, as well as sensitive personal information such as usernames, passwords, login details and even email exchanges.</p>
<p>While Google has ceased collecting information via the Street View cars, the company continues to collect data on Wi-Fi access points through smartphones connected to its Latitude service, without informing individuals, another reason for the fine, said the French. “This constitutes unfair data collection that benefits Google economically,” they  added.</p>
<p>Now of course this was all a mistake. A mistake Google has known about and continues to make. Collateral damage I guess they would call it. Acceptable in their drive for profits.</p>
<p>"As we have said before, we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data from unencrypted WiFi networks," Google's Global Privacy Counsel Peter Fleischer said in an emailed statement Monday.</p>
<p>Now it’s just a matter of time before the criminals enter the picture with roving bands of thugs with antennae sticking out of their cars. Sweeping neighborhoods, collecting data transmitted over wireless networks.</p>
<p>So once again, folks, if you have personal and sensitive stuff you want to keep private, encrypt your files, encrypt your Wi-Fi and use a hard-to-guess password.</p>

      <title>Identity theft tops consumer complaints</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) reported for the 11<sup>th</sup> straight year that identity theft was the leading complaint filed at the agency by consumers; about 250,000 complaints in 2010.</p>
<ul>
<li>Government documents/benefits fraud (19%) was the most common form of reported identity theft, followed by credit card fraud (15%), phone or utilities fraud (14%), and employment fraud (11%). Other significant categories of identity theft reported by victims were bank fraud (10%) and loan fraud (4%).</li>
<li>Government documents/benefits fraud increased 4 percentage points since calendar year 2008; identity theft-related credit card fraud, on the other hand, declined 5 percentage points since calendar year 2008.</li>
<li>Forty-two percent of identity theft complainants reported whether they contacted law enforcement. Of those victims, 72% notified a police department. Sixty-two percent indicated a report was taken.</li>
<li>Florida is the state with the highest per capita rate of reported identity theft complaints, followed by Arizona and California.  </li>
<li>And the highest percentage of thefts occurred among folks age 20-29</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/Portals/10927/images/ID%20theft%201-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="ID theft 1 resized 600"></p>
<p>It's unclear how many of the ID theft complaints are related to Internet activity. "Most people don't know how their identity was stolen," said FTC spokeswoman Claudia Bourne Farrell. "If you lose your wallet on Monday and Tuesday someone starts using your cards, you have a pretty good educated guess. Otherwise you don't. And how would you know if someone stole your identity on the Internet?"</p>
<p>As I read through the stats it seems like the moral of the story is if you’re young and live in a warm state chances are you’re a good target for ID theft. I wonder if there is a correlation with spring break?</p>

      <title>Security Crisis in Gotham: Where’s Batman?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>In October 2008 Express Scripts, one of the nation’s largest processors of pharmacy prescriptions, reported that extortionists had threated to disclose personal and medical information on millions of Americans if the company failed to meet payment demands.</p>
<p>For at least the past six years the US Department of Defense, nuclear laboratory sites and other sensitive US civilian government sites have been deeply penetrated, multiple times, by other nation-states. “China has downloaded 10 to 20 terabytes of data from the NIPRNet (the sensitive, but unclassified US military network).”</p>
<p>How did this happen? Where were the defenders in this crisis moment? Where was Batman?</p>
<p>In the paper, “A Human Capital Crisis in Cybersecurity,” “A Report of the CSIS Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44<sup>th</sup> President,” authors Evans and Reeder report on  the shortage of skilled security professionals needed to battle ever increasing waves of cybercrime.</p>
<p>According to Jim Gosler, NSA Visiting Scientist and founding director of the CIA’s Clandestine Information Technology Office, there are only about 1,000 security specialists in the United States who have the specialized skills to operate effectively in cyberspace; however the United States needs about 10,000 to 30,000 individuals.</p>
<p>According to the report there is an even more desperate shortage of people who can design secure systems, write safe computer code and create the ever more sophisticated tools needed to prevent, detect, mitigate and reconstitute from damage due to system failures and malicious acts.</p>
<p>So what to do?</p>
<p>The Commission reports that the current professional certification programs are ineffective and issue credentials which create a false sense of preparedness for both practitioners and their employers. Evans and Reeder go on to state that “in many ways cybersecurity is similar to 19<sup>th</sup> century medicine – a growing field dealing with real threats with lots of self-taught practitioners, only some of whom know what they are doing.”</p>
<p>The reports ends with the call to develop “a culture of professionalism,” and the accreditation standards and professional certifications by specialty. In the end nothing else can be tolerated if organizations and nations are to prevent, detect and respond to ever increasing threats.</p>

      <title>Researchers say near impossible to erase all data on notebook PCs</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) are becoming increasingly popular in markets such as notebook PCs and sub-notebooks for enterprises, Ultra-Mobile PCs , and Tablet PCs for the healthcare and consumer electronics sectors. For low-end applications, a USB flash drive may be obtained for $10 to $100 or so, depending on capacity.</p>
<p>However, a recent paper from computer scientists in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, reveal that that there is a right way and a wrong way to erase data from SSDs. And depending on the method you employ, your data management security could be compromised.</p>
<p>SSD is a rapidly developing technology. In 2008, EMC became the first enterprise storage vendor to ship flash-based SSDs into its product portfolio, in 2009 Dell began to offer optional 256 GB solid state drives on select notebook models, Toshiba launched a laptop with a 512 GB SSD and as of October 2010, Apple's MacBook Air line includes solid state drives as standard.</p>
<p>The problem is the internals of an SSD differ in almost every respect from a hard drive, so assuming that the erasure techniques that work for hard drives will also work for SSDs is dangerous.</p>
<p>SSDs use flash memory to store data. Flash memory is divided into pages and blocks. Because of the mismatch in granularity between erase operations and program operations in flash, in-place update of the sector at a logical block address (LBA) is not possible. This means when you write new data onto a SSD it writes the new content for the sector to another location. As a result, the old version of the data remains in digital form in the flash memory.</p>
<p>Since in-place updates are not possible in SSDs, the overwrite-based erasure techniques that work well for hard drives may not work properly for SSDs. Those techniques assume that overwriting a portion of the LBA space results in overwriting the same physical media that stored the original data. Overwriting data on an SSD results in logical sanitization (i.e., the data is not retrievable via the SATA or SCSI interface) but not digital sanitization.</p>
<p> These differences between hard drives and SSDs potentially lead to a dangerous disconnect between user expectations and the drive’s actual behavior: An SSD’s owner might apply a hard drive-centric sanitization technique under the misguided belief that it will render the data essentially irrecoverable. In truth, data may remain on the drive and require only moderate sophistication to extract.</p>
<p> Conclusion    </p>
<p>What the researchers discovered was the ability to securely destroy one file on an unencrypted disk, is nearly impossible on SSDs. They state that even the most effective file destruction methods may leave behind more than 4 percent of the original data.</p>
<p>To properly secure data and take advantage of the performance benefits that SSDs offer, you should always encrypt the entire disk and do so as soon as the operating system is installed.</p>
<p>Securely erasing SSDs after they have been used unencrypted is very difficult, and may be impossible in some cases. To read more you can access the paper here: http://www.usenix.org/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf</p>

      <title>Powerful security companies never use: Find out why</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>There is a free security feature in more than 500 million desktop and portable computers that can prevent many potential security issues. Yet only a small fraction of users have activated the embedded security, according to a study by Aberdeen Research.</p>
<p>Trusted Computing solutions leverage hardware-based “roots of trust” at the edge of the network and at the endpoints. Security solutions which rely on these hard-based roots of trust are inherently more secure from external software attack and physical theft than software only implementations.</p>
<p>On-chip security operations include: public key cryptographic functions, integrity measurement functions,  and attestation functions which provide cryptographic proof to a third party that software has not been compromised. Over the past several years vendors have been embedding the hardware and software basics for trusted computing in off-the-shelf desktop and server computers.</p>
<p>Within many of the following devices you’ll find embedded hardware that can be leveraged for trusted computing solutions: mobile devices, hard drives, storage systems, printers, network endpoints, servers and PCs.</p>
<p>So what’s the problem?</p>
<p>While a high percentage of trusted computing- ready devices and infrastructure exist, enterprise awareness about trusted computing, according to Aberdeen, is relatively low. It’s mind boggling that many security issues and crises could be avoided just by turning on a function you already own. But wait there’s more!</p>
<p>What we see in the industry, is that it is not just a case of ignorance but a case of best practices versus laggards. In other words the laggards appear to be more “ignorant” than those ranked best in class for security policy and risk management.</p>
<p>Those companies with investments in trusted computing initiatives are more likely to have developed a “holistic view of security risks and establish and enforce consistent security policies.” When the laggards were asked their top reasons for not investing in trusted computing initiatives, they responded that “benefits are not clear” and that there were “other priorities.” Talk about ignorance is bliss.</p>
<p>The chart below highlights the most typical applications created based on embedded trusted computing-ready hardware. </p>
<p>The message can’t be any clearer, if you want enhanced security, just use what you already have and turn it on!</p>

      <title>Assessing your security risk with Cloud Computing</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The Cloud Security Alliance has published some guidelines to help companies with a quick risk assessment when considering moving to the cloud. This process is not a full risk assessment framework, nor a methodology for determining all your security requirements. It’s a quick method for evaluating your tolerance for moving an asset to various cloud computing models.</p>
<p><em>(1) Identify the asset for the cloud deployment</em></p>
<p>At the simplest, assets supported by the cloud fall into two general buckets: (a) Data and (b) Applications/Functions/Processes</p>
<p>We are either moving information into the cloud, or transactions/processing (from partial functions all the way up to full applications). With cloud computing our data and applications don’t need to reside in the same location, and we can even shift only parts of functions to the cloud. For example, we can host our application and data in our own data center, while still outsourcing a portion of its functionality to the cloud through a Platform as a Service.</p>
<p>The first step in evaluating risk for the cloud is to determine exactly what data or function is being considered for the cloud. This should include potential uses of the asset once it moves to the cloud to account for scope creep. Data and transaction volumes are often higher than expected.</p>
<p><em>(2) Evaluate the asset</em></p>
<p>The next step is to determine how important the data or function is to the organization. You don’t need to perform a detailed valuation exercise unless your organization has a process for that, but you do need at least a rough assessment of how sensitive an asset is, and how important an application/function/process is.</p>
<p>For each asset, ask the following questions:</p>
<p>1. How would we be harmed if the asset became widely public and widely distributed?</p>
<p>2. How would we be harmed if an employee of our cloud provider accessed the asset?</p>
<p>3. How would we be harmed if the process or function were manipulated by an outsider?</p>
<p>4. How would we be harmed if the process or function failed to provide expected results?</p>
<p>5. How would we be harmed if the information/data were unexpectedly changed?</p>
<p>6. How would we be harmed if the asset were unavailable for a period of time?</p>
<p>Essentially we are assessing confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements for the asset; and how those are affected if all or part of the asset is handled in the cloud. It’s very similar to assessing a potential outsourcing project, except that with cloud computing we have a wider array of deployment options, including internal models.</p>
<p><em>(3) Map the asset to potential cloud deployment models</em></p>
<p>Now we should have an understanding of the asset’s importance. Our next step is to determine which deployment models we are comfortable with. Before we start looking at potential providers, we should know if we can accept the risks implicit to the various deployment models: private, public, community, or hybrid; and hosting scenarios: internal, external, or combined.</p>
<p>For the asset, determine if you are willing to accept the following options:</p>
<p>1. Public</p>
<p>2. Private, internal/on-premises</p>
<p>3. Private, external (including dedicated or shared infrastructure)</p>
<p>4. Community; taking into account the hosting location, potential service provider, and identification of other community members</p>
<p>5. Hybrid. To effectively evaluate a potential hybrid deployment, you must have in mind at least a rough architecture of where components, functions, and data will reside</p>
<p>At this stage you should have a good idea of your comfort level for transitioning to the cloud, and which deployment models and locations fit your security and risk requirements.</p>
<p><em>(4) Evaluate potential cloud service models and providers</em></p>
<p>In this step focus on the degree of control you’ll have at each SPI tier ((SPI refers to <strong>S</strong>oftware as a Service, <strong>P</strong>latform as a Service, or <strong>I</strong>nfrastructure as a Service) to implement any required risk management. If you are evaluating a specific offering, at this point you might switch to a fuller risk assessment.</p>
<p>Your focus will be on the degree of control you have to implement risk mitigations in the different SPI tiers. If you already have specific requirements (e.g., for handling of regulated data) you can include them in the evaluation.</p>
<p><em>(5) Sketch the potential data flow</em></p>
<p>And lastly, if you are evaluating a specific deployment option, map out the data flow between your organization, the cloud service, and any customers/other nodes. While most of these steps have been high-level, before making a final decision it’s absolutely essential to understand whether, and how, data can move in and out of the cloud.</p>
<p>You should now understand the importance of what you are considering moving to the cloud, your risk tolerance (at least at a high level), and which combinations of deployment and service models are acceptable. You’ll also have a rough idea of potential exposure points for sensitive information and operations.</p>

      <title>State sponsored cyberattacks</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Officials in the United Kingdom recently stated that a cyberattack from purported U.S. White House e-mail accounts actually originated from China, and the perpetrator used a hoax e-mail address that resembled a White House account. Within the emails were links that would have downloaded the Zeus malware. This is but another string of news about potential state sponsored attacks.</p>
<p>We’ve heard about the Stuxnet cyberattack against infrastructure in Iranian nuclear facilities that was purported to originate from Israeli sources. We’ve read about hacks against certain Google accounts held by dissidents of China.</p>
<p>Attacks against U.S. government facilities is a regular occurrence. And we’ve heard about U.S. government agencies gaining approvals to monitor the emails and web-based accounts of private individuals.</p>
<p>In response to this escalation of alleged (but unproved) state sponsored cyberattacks, the UK Foreign Minister, William Hague, has proposed an international conference to discuss “rules of Internet warfare.” Hague warns that such cyberattacks “poses one of the gravest threats to security.” So far there are no takers on the conference, as no one is admitting they are even involved in such activity.</p>
<p>In the scifi classic “The Day the Earth Stood Still,”  there is a climactic moment when all electric devices and machinery come to a halt, worldwide. There is a moment of silence, as this electronic Armageddon was executed upon the earth. Reducing all humans to operate on a pre-industrial age basis.</p>
<p>As technology continues to escalate, and our dependence on such advancements, could the equivalent of a cyberwarfare nuclear bomb be in development? A cyberattack so serious the Internet is shut down? Anything is possible and thus starting dialogue by the various governments about rules of cyberwarfare may not be such a bad idea.</p>

      <title>11 steps to reduce the risk of web attacks</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Here’s the follow-up to the last blog on how to reduce the risk of web attacks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep systems fully up to date and patched—including the operating system, web browsers, browser plugins, media players, PDF readers and other applications</li>
<li>The more varied your platforms and software are, the more opportunities you present to the hackers to exploit, and the more likely they are to find a vulnerability in an unpatched application. Standardize on a core set of minimal applications for interacting with the web. Enforce a policy that all users must access the internet with a common set of tools that meets the minimum requirements: includes browser, PDF reader, media player, plug-ins, add-ons and toolbars</li>
<li>Configure your browsers to ensure they are not installing plugins, add-ons, ActiveX controls and toolbars without at least a prompt</li>
<li>Check that your browser is blocking third-party cookies</li>
<li>Autocomplete or autofill is a feature in many browsers that stores information you recently typed, such as search terms, recently visited websites and your personal information (e.g., name, email, address, phone) in the interest of saving keystrokes. Consider carefully the risks of using this feature as the time you save may increase your vulnerability to attacks</li>
<li>ActiveX controls, plugins, browser helper objects (BHOs) and toolbars are all examples of browser add-ons. It’s imperative to restrict add-ons to an absolute minimum in order to reduce your threat surface area for exploits</li>
<li>Users operating remotely, at home or at a Wi-Fi hotspot should ensure their browser content filters are enabled. Most popular browsers offer at least a basic phishing and/or malware site database that can help provide protection from the most ubiquitous threats. Make sure you enable these filters on your browser</li>
<li>Popups are not only annoying resource hogs, but they also can pose a security risk by either hosting embedded malware directly, or trying to lure users into clicking on something using a well-known social engineering trick. For example, some popups can be ingeniously crafted to look like Windows dialog boxes, and the mere act of clicking the “X” to close the box can instigate a malware attack. Ensure your selected browser has popup blocking enabled</li>
<li>Use long passwords. The more characters they contain, the more secure they are. Include numbers, symbols, and upper-and lowercase characters</li>
<li>Change passwords frequently</li>
<li>A proper web security solution is a vital component of an overall strategy for safeguarding your organization from modern web threats. It will reduce your threat exposure by limiting users’ surfing activity to website categories relevant to their work, or at least help them avoid the dirty dozen categories (adult, gambling, etc.) that are a breeding ground for malware. Make sure you have the right solution selected for your organization.</li>
</ol>

      <title>SEO Poisoning</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) attacks are another way in which cybercriminals use the web to infect users with malware. They are different from the classic drive-by attack. With SEO attacks—known as “SEO poisoning”—search engine results are poisoned in order to drive user traffic to the rogue site. Google has reported that up to 1.3% of their search results are infected. So, with SEO Poisoning, you’re directed to a bad page through a poisoned search.</p>
<p><em>Malicious JavaScript the poison of choice</em></p>
<p>When directed to a compromised webpage some bad things start to happen. First, hackers inject code into legitimate web pages. The injected code could be an iframe HTML element, or an inline script. The trend is a move towards the latter. When the victim browses the compromised web page, the injected code will cause their browser to silently load malicious content from another remote site. This is invisible to the victim.</p>
<p>Typically, the content loaded will consist of multiple components designed to exploit client-side vulnerabilities. For example, a mixture of HTML, JavaScript, Flash, PDF and Java content. This bundle is typically produced by and managed with a kit, known as an exploit pack. These exploit packs are written and sold to criminals looking to infect users with malware.</p>
<p>The important thing to note is that there is no social engineering required. The user does not have to click on a link in an email, or browse potentially risky web pages. They just need to visit a legitimate website that’s been compromised.</p>
<p>Users visiting a hijacked site have no way of knowing the site has been compromised because the malicious code is invisible, and is executed as soon as the page loads in the user’s browser. The code typically uses further scripts to fetch more malicious components, which will then attempt to leverage known exploits in the browser or operating system to infect it, steal data, or subvert it into a botnet.</p>
<p>The scope of these attacks cannot be underestimated, since all types of sites—from government websites to educational institutions to popular news portals, blogs and social networking sites—have been targeted.</p>
<p>As security vendors add detection for malicious web code, the attackers constantly evolve it in order to evade being caught. Hackers have turned to using JavaScript as the “glue” for these web attacks because it provides the ability to hide or obfuscate the code, concealing the payload.</p>
<p>If your website is compromised, then you’re perceived as being responsible for infecting anyone who visits it. This can damage to your corporate reputation, result in negative publicity and a lack of confidence from customers, partners and investors. In the next blog we’ll delve into solutions to help keep you safe.</p>

      <title>Anatomy of a Security Hack: iPads and AT&amp;T</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Back in June last year, hackers were able to extract about 114,000 individual user’s personal email addresses and their ID used to authenticate them on AT&amp;T’s 3G network for Apple iPad users. Here’s how the hack happened.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T wanted to offer a convenient way of letting users log into their 3G data plan accounts, auto-populating users email address on the dashboard by referencing the unique identifier (ICC-ID) of the users’ iPad. The iPad users used AT&amp;T to access the Web. The hackers, realizing this, produced a script called the "iPad 3G Account Slurper" that utilized brute force techniques to auto-generate thousands of unique ICC-ID’s, harvesting usernames, e-mail addresses, and billing addresses as the script went on.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/10927/images/att%20login-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="AT&amp;T iPad Login" class="alignLeft" style="float: left;"></p>
<p>In this situation AT&amp;T was trying to create ease of use and convenience for their customers by reducing the number of keystrokes needed to log-in. However, tech savvy hackers were able to recognize the schema used and with malicious intent took advantage.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has now fixed the problem by removing the email auto populate feature. The issue service providers have to consider, as a result of this incident, is the trade-off between user convenience and security. We just have to look at airport security measures that resulted from the terrorists attacks in the U.S. and realize that security must trump user convenience whenever possible. Folks may not like it initially, but they will appreciate the peace of mind.</p>

      <title>What to do when your data is held hostage for a ransom</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Malware that blocks access to your computer and then demands you pay a ransom, to some criminal in a foreign country, can be a problem. Before you call the FBI and CIA first try to understand  what type of attack has occurred. Symantec had a nice overview of the different variants you might run into.</p>
<p>Some variants are very obvious in their approach. They use a combination of shock and embarrassment in order to extort money from people. The most recent example of this is Trojan.Ransomlock.F. The Trojan.Ransomlock family is a particular type of ransomware, which locks a user’s desktop. Once the desktop has been locked, it is then no longer possible to use the computer as normal. To restore access to the desktop, one typically has to send a text message to a premium rate number. A message containing the unlock code is then – hopefully – sent back to the user. (Trusting someone who has just compromised your computer and is holding you to ransom is generally not very reliable.)</p>
<p>In the case of the Trojan.Ransomlock.F variant, not only does it lock the desktop, but it also changes the desktop background to an explicit pornographic image. This additional trick has been included by the authors of the threat in order to play on the user’s insecurities. Having a graphic pornographic image emblazoned across a monitor is guaranteed to give anyone a red face. They are less likely to seek technical help from another person to solve the problem in an effort to avoid embarrassment.</p>
<p>Another approach that ransomware threats typically employ is holding a user to ransom for files on their computer. This is a relatively common tactic, but has evolved over the years, utilizing encryption in smarter ways. The general approach is to search for files on the compromised computer. When user-specific files such as .doc, .xls, .jpg, etc. are found, they are then encrypted by the threat. The encryption renders the files inaccessible. Only by obtaining the correct key can the files be decrypted and accessed. Of course, to get the key, the owner of the compromised computer has to pay out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unless the ransom money is sent to the malware authors (which has no guarantee of success), the only way to retrieve the encrypted files is from backup. Always backup!</p>
<p><strong>Boot blocking</strong><br>The most basic computer resource that an attacker can attempt to obtain a ransom for is access to the operating system itself. No operating system means no antivirus and no assistance from the Internet. Trojan. Bootlock achieves this by overwriting the master boot record (MBR) with custom code. The MBR is responsible for starting a computer’s operating system. By overwriting it with custom code, the malware authors deny a user access to the operating system.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the best way to defend against such threats is up-to-date antivirus and a regular backup routine.</p>

      <title>WikiLeaks: Security breaches from the inside</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>WikiLeaks is an organization that publishes submissions of private, secret, and classified media from anonymous news sources and news leaks. There has been a lot of publicity lately about WikiLeaks, as several government officials have criticized them for exposing classified information, harming national security, and compromising international diplomacy. Some people have even characterized the organization as irresponsible, immoral, and illegal.</p>
<p>While WikiLeaks is grueling under scrutiny, lawsuits, and criticism for releasing sensitive information, the real story I believe, is about the anonymous individuals who submitted these secret documents to WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>These folks are employees of the government or company in question who have signed confidentiality agreements, in most cases, yet because of some issue or grievance seek to expose sensitive information in an effort to embarrass, harm or bring about change to their employer. WikiLeaks is merely a vehicle for these nameless individuals.</p>
<p>There are no firewalls or security platforms to protect against this threat. Yes, there are technologies that can track documents downloaded to thumb drives, encrypt PDF documents, monitor  documents that have been printed, track emails that are sent, but when an employee, an insider, has access to key information and a copier machine there’s only so much security one can do short of monitoring every movement of every employee all day long.</p>
<p>The question I pose today is can anything be done to prevent a breach of trust? It’s an age old dilemma in the security field and something organizations continue to grapple with. It brings to mind a scene in the movie “Braveheart” when the character played by Mel Gibson realizes he has been betrayed by a man he considered a brother.</p>
<p>He was so astonished he could not move, so disappointed that he sat down in despair in the middle of the battlefield. Here was a man who was a valiant warrior and defeated armies greater in number, but who suffered a blow he was unprepared for, a blow of betrayal from a friend.</p>
<p>As we move into the New Year and gird ourselves with security strategies and plans,  it’s a good reminder that we should not only  seek to protect against external threats, but  also the enemy within the camp.</p>

      <title>Top 20 security predictions for 2011 – Part II</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Here is Part II of the top 20 security predictions for 2011.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Security continues to become part of virtual infrastructure</strong>. As more and more organizations add virtualization technologies into their environment, particularly server and desktop virtualization, security will be more embedded in the native technologies, and less of an "add-on" after the implementation is complete. In addition, security architecture design will be a "must have" element of virtual infrastructure planning and deployment, not a "nice to have."</li>
<li>
<strong>Cybercriminals take over URL shortening services</strong>. URL shortening services are becoming critical to the operation of social networks, particularly those that apply a character limit to user updates. In 2010 we saw a number of exploits using URL shortening services that lead to compromised sites. In 2011 we expect to see more sophisticated attacks using URL shortening services either by a criminal enterprise gaining control of a significant URL shortening service or one of these groups setting up a service which appears legitimate, but is not.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hackers exploit router vulnerabilities</strong>. As 2010 has proven there are many systems vulnerable to attack. We often focus on PCs, servers and devices but recently it has become apparent that routers are also open to exploit. Router vulnerabilities, allow attackers to re-route network traffic with malicious intent. As an example a user could be diverted from an online banking site to an identical-looking malicious website and their login credentials could be stolen or a business user could be diverted from a legitimate CRM, ERP or HR service allowing a hacker to access client, business or staff information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rogue marketplace</strong><strong> vendors</strong><strong> exploit online digital currencies</strong>. In 2011 social networking sites and online marketplaces will roll-out their own in-house digital virtual currencies. As an example one site already has a system in place that uses “Credits.” Attacks will soon be designed to seek to exploit these new areas for financial fraud, including specialized malware, rogue applications and phishing attacks.</li>
<li>
<strong>Botnets evolve with steganography</strong>. Since the McColo ISP takedown in November 2008, which removed the command and control servers used by cyber crooks to control the activities of their botnets, and wiped out many cybercrime operations, the cybercriminals have been looking to build business continuity practices into their operations. In 2011, we expect that botnet controllers will resort to employing steganography techniques to control their computers. This means hiding their commands in plain view – perhaps within images or music files distributed through file sharing or social networking websites.</li>
<li>
<strong>Automation advances targeted attacks</strong>. Highly targeted attacks are steadily increasing in number. These carefully crafted attacks target specific users in specific organizations and require significant effort and research on behalf of the cybercriminal. In 2011 criminal enterprises will increasingly automate this research to create a heavier volume of more powerful and convincing attacks that appear particularly relevant, interesting and/or newsworthy to the intended victims.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stuxnet strikes up malware specialization. </strong>One of the most threatening advances in malware during 2010 broadened the range of targets beyond PCs and servers when the Stuxnet Trojan attacked programmable logic controllers. In analyzing Stuxnet, it was observed that the malware was digitally signed (certified) with two legitimate certificates. Soon thereafter, a variant of the Zeus Trojan was discovered to be digitally signed using a certificate from antivirus vendor Kaspersky. This trend is alarming because Windows Vista, Windows 7 and many other products check the validity of digital signatures and warn or deny users when a certain type of software is not digitally signed. When cybercriminals use stolen certificates to digitally sign their malware, they bypass this protection with ease. This specialized malware written to exploit physical infrastructures will continue in 2011 driven by the huge sums of money available to criminal enterprises at low risk of prosecution.</li>
<li>
<strong>IT forced to implement more granular web security policies.</strong> In 2010 more than 80% of malicious threats intercepted were found on legitimate websites that had been compromised either directly or indirectly via third party provided content. At the same time categories which were once easy to block universally, like social media, are becoming increasingly business relevant. In 2011 we expect IT managers will be forced by business necessity to implement more granular and refined web security policies. Particular business units, departments or users will be granted access to certain websites or categories of sites</li>
<li>
<strong>Spam campaigns will increasingly mimic legitimate mail from popular websites</strong>. While we have seen messages like these before, we’ve noticed that they now look more legitimate than in the past. Examples of this include spammers who targeted Amazon/Flixster/GoDaddy names and a FedEx campaign. In the case of LinkedIn spam messages, we observed that the headers and body templates were taken from actual LinkedIn messages. Therefore, it’s nearly impossible for the average user to distinguish between the legitimate LinkedIn messages and the nefarious ones.</li>
<li>
<strong>Security and services continue to migrate to the Cloud</strong>. An increasingly distributed workforce is pushing organizations to the cloud for suitable security solutions that will be required to work seamlessly across multiple platforms, as users switch between devices used to store and transmit information online. In 2011 businesses will increasingly begin to reap the benefits of adopting a hybrid infrastructure that is premise-based, private cloud based and public cloud based and will seek to deliver a seamless user experience regardless of device or access location.</li>

      <title>Top 20 security predictions for 2011 – Part I</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>It’s that time of year again where the prognosticators give their predictions for 2011. We scanned the security experts and compiled their predictions, however the list was so long we had to break it into two parts. Here are security predictions 1-10.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Zero-day, polymorphic, metamorphic, multi-platform flash worm</strong> –Look for more and more well planned and executed breaches leveraging zero-day or customized malware that cannot be detected by any main-stream antivirus product.  As a result start preparing now on how to detect zero-day malware throughout your enterprise.</li>
<li>
<strong>Increase in attacks on devices</strong> on the network from printers and routers on one end to more non-traditional targets on regular desktop/server computers. The newest Alureon rootkit attempts to persist even after a reinstall of Windows 7 64-bit and a researcher has just announced a proof of concept rootkit embedded in a Broadcom network card's firmware. These attacks will become more common in 2011 since they do not require the same level of investment as attacking the supply chain with modified hardware.</li>
<li>
<strong>The virtual incident response team concept will begin to fade</strong> in favor of full time Incident Responders, Forensic Analysts, and Reverse Engineering Malware Specialists. Security Operations Centers will begin to form dedicated full-time incident response teams to respond to ongoing security threats.</li>
<li>
<strong>IPv6 will become important when IPv4 address space is exhausted</strong>. Sometime within 2011 or 2012, ARIN and regional registrars will exhaust the existing IPv4 address space. The lack of properly implemented IPv6 networks and the increasing availability of auto configured IPv6 connections from desktops and servers will lead to a "shadow network" of IPv6 tunnels which will evade many controls like intrusion detection or prevention, firewalls, content filtering, data leakage monitoring, spam filters and many other technologies we have been relying on in network security</li>
<li>
<strong>ARM hacking</strong>. Advanced RISC Machines are prevalent in cell phones and microcontrollers. As mobile phones become more advanced, and more data is stored on these devices they become a bigger target for hackers. More services runs on mobile phones, and some of them are vulnerable in the same way they are vulnerable on PCs.  In 2011 with more common tricks and more shellcodes, it will be easier for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities on mobile phones.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improved social engineering attacks.</strong> Attackers will increasingly make use of social-engineering tactics to bypass technological security controls, fine-tuning their techniques to exploit natural human predispositions (curiosity, greed, lust, friends). We've already seen such approaches succeed at influencing victims into clicking on questionable links, opening exploit-laden attachments, and installing malicious software.</li>
<li>
<strong>Social media</strong>. More organizations will adopt social media as a core aspect of their marketing strategy. Organizations will have a hard time controlling online social networking activities of their users. Attackers will continue to take advantage of the still-evolving understanding of online social networking safety practices to defraud people and organizations.</li>
<li>
<strong>A worm will eat all the iPhones and convert the Androids to bricks</strong>. Your smartphone knows where you are, has access to your email, appointments, phone contacts, it is part of the way you surf the web, soon you will be able to make purchases with it and it has very little security or privacy built into it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Memory scraping will become more common</strong>. Browsers are notorious for leaving things sitting around in memory during web sessions. The RAM Scraping malware also targets encryption keys in memory to decrypt anything for session data to encrypted files. As far as the emerging security threat part, we are seeing RAM scraping more commonly now as attackers focus on client-side attacks, shifting away from server-side attacks. Browsers are often misconfigured, allowing malware to get onto a user's system, stealing credit card data and passwords.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extreme disclosure</strong>. The next few years will bring a rapid increase in forces seeking to expose businesses and governments alike (e.g. Wiki – leaks). This will cause a ratcheting down of information management policy, increased instrumentation, and massive litigation.</li>
</ol>

      <title>Which is more secure, a PC or a Mac?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Antivirus vendor ESET released the results of a survey that found more than half of Americans believe that PCs are "very" or "extremely" vulnerable to cybercrime attacks, while only 20 percent say the same about Macs. But is this perception real or an illusion?</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/10927/images/PCvMacESET_610x211.png" border="0" alt="PC vs Mac security"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some security experts gathered by CNET weighed in on the topic. The summarized responses are below. Here’s the short of it, there’s a difference between safe and secure. A house in the rich part of town maybe safer, because fewer folks in that neighborhood are attempting to break-in. While a house in the poorer section of town may be less safe because more folks there are trying to break-in.</p>
<p>However the houses themselves may be of equal security with doors, locks and burglar alarms. And so it is with PCs run with Windows and Macs powered by OSX. More criminals attack Windows compared to Macs, because there are more Windows machines and thus more opportunities to do damage and profit. So by default you may be safer with a Mac, but not because of some inherent technical advantage, but because you’re in a neighborhood where less people are trying to break-in.</p>
<p><em>What the experts said</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mac users are just as vulnerable to Web-based attacks like phishing as PC users are, and Mac users who fall prey to phishing tend to lose more money on average than PC users</li>
<li>A lot of attacks have to do with social engineering and that kind of attack is platform agnostic</li>
<li>[Criminals] would far rather attack Windows PCs as there are lots more of them. So you are much less likely to be bothered by malware if you use a Mac, or run Linux on your PC</li>
<li>In my mind, the OS question is quickly becoming moot, and will soon be replaced by the already-intense Web browser holy wars--especially with Google jumping into the fray there</li>
<li>Social engineering is the unifying threat that puts all computer users at risk, regardless of operating system. And that's what most threats exploit</li>
<li>Browser security is one of the more important items to consider today from a risk perspective</li>
<li>Mac is probably more secure in that more people write Windows exploits. This would probably change if the majority of people had Macs</li>
<li>Mac OS has far more published vulnerabilities per user than Windows does </li>
<li>I just don't think this question (Mac or PC) has any real meaning today. Far more relevant to me are the browser and e-mail clients a consumer is using, irrespective of the operating system or hardware platform</li>
<li>Mac OS has fewer countermeasures [against attacks compared to Windows] and lots of easily exploitable bugs, but the market share is low, making it a less likely target</li>
<li>Operating systems as such are no longer the primary target of consumer-targeted attacks; applications are. In light of that fact, I'd say each operating system has its benefits and liabilities. The real risks lie in the consumer's browser choice, and security habits. From a browser standpoint, I would choose Firefox over IE, and IE over Safari</li>
<li>Choices and practices define security more than an operating system does</li>
<li>The security posture of the average Internet user depends less on their computing platform and more on their browser choice and configuration</li>
<li>Regardless of the operating system, the easiest way for an attacker to compromise a system is by going after the application level and causing the user to click, open, or run something they should not</li>
<li>Technologically speaking, PCs are a little more secure than Macs. Macs have a larger attack surface out of the box (Flash, Java, support for a million file formats, etc.) and lack some anti-exploitation technologies found in PCs like full ASLR [Address Space Layout Randomization]. This means Macs have more vulnerabilities and it's easier to turn a vulnerability into an exploit on the platform. Despite the fact it is less secure, paradoxically, Macs are actually safer to use for most people. This is because there simply isn't much risk of being exploited or installing malware</li>
</ul>

      <title>Designing security systems like the Google Android</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Google’s popular mobile phone, the Android, offers some valuable insight into how to make a hacker  safe network. Android programs are Java applications and operate in a "sandbox" with no access to other applications, hardware or the OS except though tightly controlled interfaces. In order to reach out of the sandbox through an interface to a sensitive resource, a program must be granted permission by the user.</p>
<p>The built-in security design of the system was necessary because Google runs a program for independent software developers (ISV) that aims to create a library of thousands of applications that run on the Android. Therefore Google needed a way to prevent one ISV application from disrupting others when running simultaneously.</p>
<p><em>Security Architecture</em></p>
<p>A central design point of the Android security architecture is that no application, by default, has permission to perform any operations that would adversely impact other applications, the operating system, or the user. This includes reading or writing the user's private data (such as contacts or e-mails), reading or writing another application's files, performing network access, keeping the device awake, etc.</p>
<p>An application's process runs in a security sandbox. The sandbox is designed to prevent applications from disrupting each other, except by explicitly declaring the permissions they need for additional capabilities not provided by the basic sandbox. The system handles requests for permissions in various ways, typically by automatically allowing or disallowing based on certificates or by prompting the user. The permissions required by an application are declared statically in that application, so they can be known up-front at install time and will not change after that.</p>
<p><em>Application Signing</em></p>
<p>All Android applications (.apk files) must be signed with a certificate whose private key is held by their developer. This certificate identifies the author of the application. The certificate does not need to be signed by a certificate authority: it is perfectly allowable, and typical, for Android applications to use self-signed certificates. The certificate is used only to establish trust relationships between applications, not for wholesale control over whether an application can be installed. The most significant ways that signatures impact security is by determining who can access signature-based permissions and who can share user IDs.</p>
<p>User IDs and File Access</p>
<p>Each Android package (.apk) file installed on the device is given its own unique Linux user ID, creating a sandbox for it and preventing it from touching other applications (or other applications from touching it). This user ID is assigned to it when the application is installed on the device, and remains constant for the duration of its life on that device. Because security enforcement happens at the process level, the code of any two packages cannot normally run in the same process, since they need to run as different Linux users.</p>
<p><em>Epilogue</em></p>
<p>As we look over the evolution of the technology industry, we have seen the movement from mainframe computers to desktop computers, to networked computers to netbook computers and now to palm-sized mobile computing devices. And in this era of mobility, users see no  IT people, network usage guidelines or instruction manuals. They just  expect their applications to work and be secure just like their kitchen  fridge - which rarely disappoints the hungry soul. The secure computing platforms of the future, therefore, may look a lot like the Android.</p>

      <title>Monkey-in-the-middle Web Browser Attacks</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>My kids like playing monkey-in-the-middle, a game where one person stands between two others and tries to intercept a ball thrown across the middle. In the realm of cyber security there is nefarious attack similar to this children’s game termed  “man-in-the-browser.” Man-in-the browser is being used to successfully bypass authentication mechanisms used by online banking sites and hack into customer accounts.</p>
<p>The attack works like this: a user on their bank’s website enters  his  user name and PIN into the site. As the web page is being rendered, a piece of software now resident in your browser (a trojan unknowingly downloaded) wakes up and inserts a few additional lines into the code - maybe five lines of javascript - an alert box, a timer function, and maybe some in-page content -and sends a message to the criminal.</p>
<p>What happens next looks perfectly normal. Upon loading, the alert box pops up - and says "Server synchronization in process... please be patient," or something to that effect.</p>
<p>Except at that moment, as you check the incoming messages on your BlackBerry, and sip that morning cup of caramel brulee latte, secure in the knowledge that these sophisticated systems and occasional waiting periods are the "price of modern security," a hacker somewhere is receiving a timely message that you have started an authenticated session and are ready to transact. At this point, using the credentials contained in the message the criminal can simply log in as you.</p>
<p>Imperva, a data security firm, predicts that these type of attacks will be among the top ten security threats with increasing incidences in 2011. So what can you do?</p>
<p>Part of the frustration with a man-in-the-browser attack is that the bug is very hard to detect and even harder to remove from the system. Unlike many other forms of intrusive viruses, a man-in-the-browser trojan operates between the browser security protocols and the input of the user. This means that standard security measures normally will not even reveal the presence of the man-in-the-browser virus.</p>
<p>One of the most effective methods in combating this attack is through an out-of-band (OOB) transaction verification process. This overcomes the man-in-the-browser trojan by verifying the transaction details, as received by the host (bank), to the user (customer) over a channel other than the browser; typically an automated telephone call.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is this - no matter what you see going on during your session, if you see something "different" or unexpected happening during your online banking session, close your browser immediately, and call your bank or online broker.</p>

      <title>How to fight botnets and improve security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Methods for detecting bots can generally be divided into two categories— those that involve <em>static analysis</em>, or checking computers’ characteristics against a list of known threats, and those that involve <em>behavioral analysis</em>, or monitoring communications in a network for behaviors that are known to be exhibited by botnets.</p>
<p>Static analysis results in more reliable judgments, but requires threat signatures that are current and available. Behavioral analysis potentially allows for much broader detection methods (especially by aggregating information from multiple sources), but is more likely to result in false positives. Effective botnet detection strategies generally involve aspects of both static analysis and behavioral analysis.</p>
<p>Static Analysis</p>
<p>Static analysis methods involve checking items against a known list of malicious or dangerous items, such as executable binaries, URLs, and IP addresses. If the list is accurate and up-to-date, this process can be a very fast and relatively risk-free way to identify bad items. In practice, however, static analysis alone is not an effective way to keep a network free of botnets, because of the continuing efforts of malware authors to generate fully undetected threats.  </p>
<p>Malware authors use a variety of techniques to avoid detection by antivirus tools and security researchers. These techniques include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polymorphism, which involves the creation of multiple unique but functionally identical malware files</li>
<li>URL obfuscation methods, such as using escape sequences and converting an IP address to its decimal representation</li>
<li>Changing IP addresses rapidly, and using large numbers of alternate URLs that connect to the same resource (or copies of the same resource)</li>
<li>Serving different downloads or web pages depending on factors like the time of day or the origin of the request (for example, serving clean web pages to requests coming from security software vendors)</li>
</ul>
<p>Behavioral Analysis</p>
<p>Behavioral analysis can be a powerful tool for identifying botnets, but processing time, the need for an appropriate environment in which to observe the computer’s behavior, and the danger of false positives can make diagnosis difficult. The process is further complicated by the tendency of some malware to refuse to run if it detects that it is being executed in a virtual or isolated environment, or a debugger.</p>
<p>It was once common to see bots that would attempt connections to each port on a target computer in sequence (a port scan). This technique allowed the target to recognize an attacker quite easily. Now it appears that most bots use targeted attacks in their efforts to spread. They examine only a small number of ports, which are generally those that are in use by some other service and therefore open to connections.</p>
<p>Honeypots</p>
<p>A <em>honeypot </em>is a computer that is configured by security analysts to act as a deliberate target for malware infection. The intent is to collect malware infections so that their behavior can be analyzed in detail, and in some cases to collect logs of the bots’ activities. The Honeynet Project (http://honeynet.org), one of the best known sources of honeypot data, provides information, tools, and techniques for setting up honeypots and analyzing the data they provide.</p>
<p>Darknets</p>
<p>A <em>darknet </em>is a subnet of unused IP addresses that are monitored for incoming traffic. The intent is to detect malware as it scans a subnet while crossing over the darknet. Data can also be used to identify network configuration issues. Darknets can be used to host flow collectors, DDoS backscatter detectors, and intrusion detection systems as well as to redirect traffic to honeypots.</p>

<p>And when all else fails you can always go the legal route which involves applying in federal court for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to shut down the malicious domains at the registry level.</p>
<p>Legal actions have been based on a three-pronged approach and aim to:</p>
<ol>
<li>disrupt the peer-to-peer command and control mechanism</li>
<li>disrupt the DNS/HTTP command and control mechanism; and</li>
<li>disrupt the top two tiers of command and control </li>

      <title>How Botnets Attack: Tricks of the Trade</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p><em>Spamming</em></p>
<p>Most of the spam that is sent today originates from botnets, which use several different techniques to get their unwanted messages past recipients’ mail filters. In addition to renting out their botnets to spammers, bot-herders also use the botnets’ spamming functionality themselves, sending out disguised copies of the bot malware (or hyperlinks to hosted copies of it) in an effort to increase the size of the network.</p>
<p>Attackers have traditionally found new potential victims by crawling the web or buying lists from other spammers. Bots can be used to harvest high quality email addresses. For example, the HTTP botnet family Win32/Waledac searches through many different kinds of files on fixed and remote drives on compromised computers looking for addresses.</p>
<p>Bots can steal very specific information from computers, which makes them especially useful for spear phishing, a type of phishing attack that targets the employees or customers of a particular institution.</p>
<p>Spambots, as bots that send spam are sometimes called, also give attackers access to tens of thousands of computers or more that can be used to originate spam. Typically, a prospective spammer contacts a bot-herder to rent the services of a botnet. After the spammer and bot controller negotiate the product and price, the bot controller instructs each of the selected bots to start a proxy server, and typically provides the spammer with access to a webpage that lists the IP addresses of the selected bots and the ports on which they are running their proxy servers.</p>
<p><em>Phishing</em></p>
<p>Phishing is a method of credential theft that tricks Internet users into revealing personal or financial information online. Attackers send messages purporting to be from a trusted institution, such as a bank, auction site, online game, or other popular website. These phishing messages—which are often generated and sent by bots, like spam—direct victims to webpages run by the attackers, where they are instructed to submit private information such as login credentials or credit card details.</p>
<p><em>Stealing Confidential Data</em></p>
<p>Many bots can be commanded to search a computer’s hard disks for personal information, including computer authentication credentials, bank account numbers and passwords, product keys for popular computer games and other software products, and other sensitive data. Some of the earliest malicious bots included the ability to transmit product keys back to the attacker, and such features are common in kit–based bots such as Win32/Rbot and Win32/Zbot.</p>
<p><em>Perpetrating Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks</em></p>
<p>One of the oldest attacker uses of botnets is as a mechanism for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make a computer resource, such as network connectivity and services, unavailable to its intended users. Typically, such attacks flood the resource with network traffic, which saturates its bandwidth and renders it unavailable to perform legitimate services. A DDoS attack involves multiple computers—such as those in a botnet—attacking a target at the same time, making it harder to defend against than an attack from a single computer. Several common bots, including Win32/Hamweq, Win32/Pushbot, and Win32/Waledac, have been observed participating in DDoS attacks.</p>
<p><em>Installing Malware and Potentially Unwanted Software</em></p>
<p>Bot-herders often use their botnets to download additional malware to victims’ computers to reap additional profits. Early botnets often focused on installing adware, spyware, and other potentially unwanted software in an effort to earn quick profits. In a typical incident in 2005, a bot-herder in California used the bot family Win32/Rbot to install adware on more than 20,000 computers as part of a pay-per-click advertising scheme that brought in more than U.S. $50,000, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>

      <title>Attack of the 50 foot Botnet Monster</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Yes the title is a little dramatic, but I wanted to bring attention to a recent Microsoft report, <em>Security Intelligence Report (SIR) volume 9</em>, which covers the period from January through June 2010. The report, based on data received from more than 600 million systems worldwide and internet services, singles out botnets as the single greatest source of cybercrime in the world today.</p>
<p>Based on the importance of the topic, today we begin a 4-part series on botnets: what they are, how they attack and what you can do to defend against them.</p>
<p><strong>What is a botnet?</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this analysis, the <em>Security Intelligence Report </em>defines a botnet as a network of computers that can be illicitly and secretly controlled at will by an attacker and commanded to take a variety of actions. Under this definition, a trojan downloader that is only designed to download arbitrary files and cannot otherwise be controlled by the attacker would not be considered a bot. Microsoft desktop anti-malware products removed bots from 6.5 million computers around the world in 2Q10.</p>
<p>Computers in a botnet, called <em>nodes </em>or <em>zombies</em>, are often ordinary computers sitting on desktops in homes and offices around the world. Typically, computers become nodes in a botnet when attackers illicitly install malware that secretly connects the computers to the botnet and they perform tasks such as sending spam, hosting or distributing malware or other illegal files, or attacking other computers.</p>
<p><img src="/Portals/10927/images/botnetatack-resized-600.png" border="0" alt="botnetatack resized 600"></p>
<p>Attackers usually install bots by exploiting vulnerabilities in software or by using social engineering tactics to trick users into installing the malware. Users are often unaware that their computers are being used for malicious purposes.</p>
<p>By keeping a low profile, bots are sometimes able to remain active and operational for years. The growth of always-on Internet services such as residential broadband has aided bot-herders by insuring that a large percentage of the computers in the botnet are accessible at any given time. Botnets are also attractive to criminals because they provide an effective mechanism for covering the tracks of the botnet herder—tracing the origin of an attack leads back to the hijacked computer of an innocent user, which makes it difficult for investigators to proceed further.</p>
<p>The botnet world is divided between bot families that are closely controlled by individual groups of attackers and bot families that are produced by <em>malware kits</em>. These kits are collections of tools, sold and shared within the malware underground, that enable aspiring bot-herders to assemble their own botnet by creating and spreading customized malware variants.</p>
<p>Bot operators use several tactics to attack organizations, companies, and individuals in an effort to achieve their goals. Being aware of and understanding the different attacking mechanisms can help IT and security professionals gain a deeper understanding of the nature of the botnet, the purpose behind it, and sometimes even the origin of the attack.</p>

      <title>Wiretapping the Internet for the sake of security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The NY Times reported that the U.S. government is preparing a bill for Congress that seeks”sweeping new regulations for the Internet, arguing that their ability to wiretap criminal and terrorism suspects is ‘going dark’ as people increasingly communicate online instead of by telephone.”</p>
<p>The bill would force all Internet-based service providers to have the infrastructure to comply with a wiretap order that enables the government to intercept and unscramble encrypted messages sent by any communication service; whether it be peer-to-peer, mobile device, social networking or email.</p>
<p>Proposed requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communications services that encrypt messages must have a way to unscramble them</li>
<li>Foreign-based providers that do business inside the United States must install a domestic office capable of performing intercepts</li>
<li>Developers of software that enables peer-to-peer communication must redesign their service to allow interception</li>
<li>Providers that fail to comply would face fines or some other penalty</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally this news has created cries of “Big Brother” and fear of threats to individual privacy rendered under the “war on terrorism.”  But before there is a call to arms for proletariats everywhere to battle the government with pitchforks and hammers, we must consider what happened with Internet surveillance software in the workplace.</p>
<p>When an employee signs an agreement that acknowledges an employer’s rights to monitor any activities performed using company assets (phone, computer), the employee is restricted to what he or she can do with company assets. However, most companies because of limited IT resources and inability to monitor thousands of communications daily, filter on websites, words or patterns from a probabilistic algorithm. They can’t monitor and respond to everything so they create filters that flag on a relatively few things that can create liability for the employer.</p>
<p>So any wiretapping, I’m assuming, would have to focus on the key flags germane to a probabilistic chance of some criminal activity. It would have to be considered along with other pieces of information before any assessment is made.  Therefore it is unlikely, I hope, that the government would be spending time and effort to monitor billions of transactions, just to collar someone who is cheating on a spouse.  As for me I’ll just keep on plowing ahead with my pitchfork and hay.</p>

      <title>Why security scans of the eye can be wrong</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Remember those spy movies where the good guy is trying to break into a high-security facility and either a fingerprint or retinal scan is required to gain access? So the hero knocks out the person with security clearance, or puts a gun in his back and places their hand over the scanner or lifts up the eyelid and places it against the scanner to gain access.</p>
<p>Well a recent report from National Research Council, commissioned by agencies that include the Department of Homeland Security states that biometric systems are “inherently fallible.” So in the scenario above, what a bummer if the person with supposed security clearance now is denied access at a crucial moment.</p>
<p>Biometric systems are security solutions that identify individuals based on unique biological characteristics like fingerprints, retinal patterns, voice, or facial features.The weakness in these systems is that “characteristics largely perceived as positive identifiers actually can change over a person’s lifetime due to age, disease, or other factors. This can lead to false-positives or an inability for a system to make an ID at all.”</p>
<p>Why all the fuss? The Indian government has just announced a plan to provide its 1.2 billion citizens with state-of-the-art biometric identification cards. The cards will carry retina and fingerprint data and credit and criminal histories, and will be linked to a central online database. If the perception exists that biometrics are infallible, what a mess it will be if the government accuses you of not being who you say you are—because stored biometric data doesn’t match your current physical state.</p>
<p>The U.S. has also created a Biometrics Identity Management Agency (BIMA) that has a responsibility that spans the entire U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and would specifically support the DoD's "authoritative biometrics database" in the name of national security. They will be even able to identify people using samples of bacteria collected from their computer keyboards and mice.</p>
<p>However, the margin of error and human consequence is still too high to rely solely on these systems for definitive identification. Therefore the National Research Council recommends a portfolio strategy when it comes to biometric security systems—similar to a network in-depth strategy that relies on several levels of security systems for identification, verification and action.</p>

      <title>Backward focused security and targeted killings</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>I was reading two articles this weekend which seemed to converge in my simple mind and gave way to an audacious scenario. The first was “The Law and Policy of Targeted Killings” by Gabriella Blum and Philip Heyman. Blum and Heyman are Harvard Law School professors who wrote a paper for the Harvard Security Journal that explored the U.S. policy of “targeted killing—the deliberate assassination of a known terrorist outside the country’s territory…an essential part of their counterterrorism strategy. ..an inevitable means of frustrating the activities of terrorists who are directly involved in plotting and instigating attacks from outside their territory.”</p>
<p>The paper discussed the “complex legal, political, and moral judgments” and very broad implications involved in a policy of targeted killings as a coercive tactic employed in the war on terrorism.  Blum  and Heyman state “Unlike detention or interrogation, it is not designed to capture the terrorist, monitor his or her actions, or extract information; simply put, it is designed to eliminate the terrorist.”</p>
<p>Then I read a Forbes article about how many corporations practice backward focused or reactive network security. An example given is when a network breach occurs where valuable data or property is stolen, valued in the millions. The response then is to hire a security firm to harden the network or initiate other company wide changes to prevent the breach from reoccurring.</p>
<p>This example was likened to what happened with airport security. It was after someone tried to detonate a bomb in their shoe and hide a bomb in their underwear that the policy of removing shoes and full body scans was initiated at airport screening gates. The security policy was in response to an event, rather than proactive in which the most likely methods a terrorist would use were anticipated and thus preventive initiatives were put in place ahead of an actual event.</p>
<p>Here’s where the two articles converged in my head. What if a cyber security attack of a nefarious nature led to a response that included the targeted, contractual killing of the cyber terrorist? What if the war on terrorism were to classify cyber terrorists in the same manner as terrorists hell-bent on destruction of human life and property?</p>
<p>Sound farfetched? Well consider the NSA’s (National Security Agency) <em>Defense in Depth</em> strategy as laid out in their paper, “<em>A practical strategy for achieving Information Assurance in today’s highly networked environments</em>” which begins with the following paragraph:</p>
<p>“Adversaries, Motivations, Classes of Attack. To effectively resist attacks against its information and information systems, an organization needs to characterize its adversaries, their potential motivations, and their classes of attack.  Potential adversaries might include: Nation States, Terrorists, Criminal Elements, Hackers, or Corporate Competitors.”</p>
<p>It’s a chilling thought that a backward focused response to a cyber attack could lead to targeted killings as a way of eliminating the reoccurrence of the threat. But even in the remote recesses of my imagination I could only see a scenario like that developing from a position of desperation and fear.</p>
<p>However, you’ll never have to be in that position if you have a forward-focused security strategy. In the words of Jeffrey Carr, the CEO of Taia Global, Inc: “Manage the risks that lie before you; anticipating the who, what, when, where, and how of an unknown adversary who may be targeting you and your company, or determining if you even are a target in the first place. You can’t do any of this if your entire approach to cyber security is looking at repairing what just transpired and preventing that same attack from happening in the future. If you do, you’ll always be surprised by a new attack vector…”</p>

      <title>Massive attack on Iran nuclear facilities</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>This past weekend Iranian authorities reported that the Stuxnet worm, one of the most sophisticated malware programs ever written, had infected thousands of PCS that manage large-scale industrial-control systems in manufacturing and utility companies.</p>
<p>These control systems, called SCADA, for "supervisory control and data acquisition," operate everything from power plants and factory machinery to oil pipelines and military installations.</p>
<p>While no blame has been assigned to this attack, there is rumor that it was a focused attempt to disrupt Iran’s nuclear facilities. The destructive Stuxnet worm has surprised experts because it is the first one specifically created to take over industrial control systems, rather than just steal or manipulate data.</p>
<p>Alan Bentley, senior international vice president at security firm Lumension, said Stuxnet is "the most refined piece of malware ever discovered", and that the worm was significant because "mischief or financial reward wasn't its purpose, it was aimed right at the heart of a critical infrastructure".</p>
<p>Stuxnet works by exploiting previously unknown security holes in Microsoft's Windows operating system. It then seeks out a component called SimaticWinCC, manufactured by Siemens, which controls critical factory operations. The malware even uses a stolen cryptographic key belonging to the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer RealTek to validate itself in high-security factory systems.</p>
<p>The worm then takes over the computer running the factory process – which for WinCC would be "mission-critical" systems which have to keep functioning under any circumstance – and "blocks" it for up to a tenth of a second. For high-speed systems, such as the centrifuges used for nuclear fuel processing being done by Iran, that could be disastrous, experts suggested.</p>
<p>Graham Cluley, senior consultant with the security company Sophos, stated that Siemens has "astonishingly" advised power plants and manufacturing facilities not to change the default password that allows access to functions, despite it being exploited by Stuxnet and being "public knowledge on the web for years".</p>
<p>The United States is also tracking the worm, and the Department of Homeland Security is building specialized teams that can respond quickly to cyber emergencies at industrial facilities across the country.</p>

      <title>How to harden your Windows OS for maximum security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The title to this week’s blog sounds like nirvana, but like anything else the devil is in the details. Most companies who deliver an application in a hardware appliance form factor “harden” the operating system (OS). This means they disable certain functions in the OS and create configuration settings which allow the OS to only function for the desired needs of the application. Therefore an end user cannot run other applications on the appliance. It also means certain access points exploited by hackers and criminals are no longer available.</p>
<p>Hardening should only be done by a professional, however there are several benefits for those who desire to “lock” down Windows and create a more secure environment for their applications.  For example, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harden your server's TCP and IP stack (Netbios, ICMP, SYN, SYN-ACK). By hardening the IP stack your network can sustain or completely thwart various sophisticated network attacks</li>
<li>Protect your servers from Denial-of-Service and other network-based attacks</li>
<li>Enable SYN flood protection when an attack is detected</li>
<li>Set the threshold values that are used to determine what constitutes an attack</li>
<li>Reduce potential intrusion vectors by disabling non-used services</li>
<li>Proactively disable scripting or Active-X controls which proofed potential propagation vectors in the past and continue to be exploited</li>
</ul>
<p> An example, provided by Harden-IT™ of the effectiveness of hardening Windows in a Ddos attack is illustrated in the graph below:</p>

<p>So how do you harden Windows? For Windows XP, NT, 2000 and 2003 some of the methods involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Adjusting retransmission of SYN-ACKS</strong>. This makes connection responses time out more quickly during a SYN flood.</li>
<li>
<strong>Determining how many times TCP retransmits</strong> an unacknowledged data segment on an existing connection. TCP retransmits data segments until they are acknowledged or until this value expires.<strong></strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Disabling ICMP Router Discovery Protocol</strong> (IRDP) where an attacker may remotely add default route entries on a remote system.</li>
<li>
<strong>Disabling these services</strong>: 
<ul>
<li>Telnet </li>
<li>Universal Plug and Play Device Host </li>
<li>IIS (not installed by default) </li>
<li>Netmeeting Remote Desktop Sharing </li>
<li>Remote Desktop Help Session Manager </li>
<li>Remote Registry </li>
<li>Routing &amp; Remote Access </li>
<li>SSDP Discovery Service </li>
<li>Disable any non-active accounts and delete any accounts which are no longer required</li>
<li>Disable Guest accounts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Use the Local Security Policy</strong> snap-in to strengthen the system policies for password acceptance. Microsoft suggests that you make the following changes: 
<ul>
<li>Set the minimum password length to at least 8 characters </li>
<li>Set a minimum password age appropriate to your network (typically between 1 and 7 days) </li>
<li>Set a maximum password age appropriate to your network (typically no more than 42 days) </li>
<li>Set a password history maintenance (using the "Remember passwords" radio button) of at least 6 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Disable Enumeration of SIDS</strong>. Even after renaming Guest and Administrator accounts, an intruder armed with the right software can still find the real account by enumerating the account SIDs (Security Identifiers) because renaming an account does not change its SID. Once an account name has been identified (an attacker is looking for an Administrator account here) a brute force attack on the password is usually the next step. This can be avoided by not allowing the enumeration of Account SIDs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Disable File and Print Sharing</strong>. If you use an always-on high-speed Internet connection, leaving these services turned on is like leaving your doors open when you are not at home. Unless it is absolutely necessary, turn these services off.</li>
<li>
<strong>Disable Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop</strong>. This applies to Windows XP machines only. Remote assistance allows you to invite another person to logon to your machine for remote troubleshooting. Leave it disabled. You can always re-enable it later if the service is ever needed. Remote desktop is available on XP Professional and allows you access to a Windows session on one computer while you are at another computer in another location, not only over a LAN, but over the Internet as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>Disable any unnecessary and potentially dangerous service</strong>. The three most common services to turn off are Windows Plug and Play, DCOM, and Windows Messenger.</li>
<li>
<strong>Encrypt the My Documents and Temp folders</strong>. Both Windows XP and Windows 2000 allow you to encrypt selected data files and folders in your computer. By doing this, even if your computer is compromised by an attacker, you have an extra layer of security for your most used files by denying access to anyone except the user that encrypted the files to begin with.</li>
<li>
<strong>Set account lockout policy.</strong>Windows XP includes an account lockout feature that will disable an account after an administrator-specified number of logon failures.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use a BIOS and Bootlevel Password</strong>. Once you set a Boot level BIOS password, it will be required every time the system is started. The system is completely disabled until the password is entered. This is normally accomplished by selecting the password option in the BIOS setup. You may also want to consider an additional password for accessing the BIOS settings in order to prevent unauthorized changes in the BIOS settings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use NTFS File system</strong>. When Windows XP or Windows 2000 is installed, it should be installed on a separate partition formatted with the NTFS File system rather than the older FAT File system. The NTFS system allows you to configure which users have access to which data, who can perform what kinds of operations, and allows you to encrypt files and data.</li>
<li>
<strong>Disable auto-logins</strong>. Do not use any automated logins and be sure all users are password protected. </li>
</ul>
<p> These are some of the most common methods used to harden Windows. There are others, but this is a good start.</p>

      <title>I know where you’ve been: security and privacy concerns with Wi-Fi </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>So what’s all the hoopla about Google and others collecting Wi-Fi data over public airwaves? Google, Apple and others have been building databases containing data about Wi-Fi networks, cell tower location, GPS data and device MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. The data can be used to identify wireless routers and when combined with data about the network's signal strength and other information, such as cell tower and GPS readings, one can get a very clear idea of where Wi-Fi users are located.</p>
<p>Because their databases strip out personally identifiable information, the data collectors say that consumers are safe. However privacy advocates say it is possible for the truly motivated to find a way to use Google's database of location information to secretly figure out people's addresses.</p>
<p>In an e-mailed statement, Google said, "It's important to remember that MAC addresses are a simple hardware ID assigned by the manufacturer. We do not collect any information about householders, nor can we identify an individual from the MAC address data. This data is publicly broadcast, and it's identical to what any person could learn by walking near the location with a Wi-Fi-enabled device. At no point does Google publicly disclose MAC addresses from its database."</p>
<p>However, this statement hasn’t stopped folks from thinking about Big Brother knowing their whereabouts based on access points, or employers tracking employees without consent to know where their employees are on company time.</p>
<p>We must realize that wireless technology by its nature transmits data over an open frequency, i.e. public airspace. And if someone really wants to find out personal information about you all they have to do is use any of the many web services that will search every public database to reveal all sorts of things about your life.</p>
<p>However in terms of network security the more pressing concern is that when using wireless networks are our e-mail messages, passwords, or anything sent without encryption on a wireless network protected? If this is the primary concern, versus location specific data, then consider the steps you should take to protect your wireless network and the computers on it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use encryption to scramble communications over the network. If you have a choice, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is stronger than Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).</li>
<li>Use anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and a firewall.</li>
<li>Most wireless routers have a mechanism called identifier broadcasting. Turn it off so your computer won't send a signal to any device in the vicinity announcing its presence.</li>
<li>Change the identifier on your router from the default so a hacker can't use the manufacturer's default identifier to try to access your network.</li>
<li>Change your router's pre-set password for administration to something only you know. The longer the password, the tougher it is to crack.</li>
<li>Allow only specific computers to access your wireless network.</li>
<li>Turn off your wireless network when you know you won't use it.</li>
<li>Don't assume that public "hot spots" are secure. You may want to assume that other people can access any information you see or send over a public wireless network.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cyber-Jihad: Malware in the name of religion or financial gain?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>A new email-based attack was reported this month based on a new variant of an older worm that tempts potential victims into clicking on purported documents or sex movies. When the malware executes, it tries to disable the victim's security software and propagates the malicious message to contacts in the user's address book.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about this attack is that it is linked to a group , Brigades of Tariq ibnZiyad, a self-proclaimed "cyber-jihad" organization that aims to wage cyber war against  the U.S. Army and similar institutions.</p>
<p>The worm downloads a Trojan that's set to connect to a server of a similar name of the organization. While the actual attack was simple, it was effective because it took a slightly different spin on an old trick. The payload wasn't the suspicious .exe or .ZIP file, but an HTML file, according to Luis Chapetti, lead security analyst at Barracuda Networks.</p>
<p>“This outbreak was actually kind of simple," Chapetti said. "All it did was spam itself out. They could have just as easily added a password stealer to the download list and, with more sophisticated code, dynamically changed the download site and keep the worm alive for a long time.” This brings up the question, is this attack a trial run for a more nefarious attack in the future? And is the goal to simply disrupt a U.S. government institution’s network in the name of religion, or is this really just another criminal act, with financial gain as the ultimate objective?</p>
<p>And speaking of financial gain, researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara published a report that exposed details about how the infamous Torpig/Sinowal/Anserin botnet operates, its makeup, who it typically victimizes, and just what type of financial data it's stealing.</p>
<p>Torpig has been a hot subject for researchers for some time: RSA <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/security/vulnerabilities/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211800540"></a> revealed that the so-called Sinowal Trojan, a.k.a. Torpig and Mebroot, had been stealing data for about three years, and had successfully swiped 300,000 online bank accounts, credit and debit card accounts, and an unknown number of email and FTP accounts. The botnet's malware "may be one of the most pervasive and advanced pieces of crimeware ever created by fraudsters," researchers say.</p>
<p>The researchers counted 1,660 different stolen credit and debit card accounts, 49 percent of which belonged to victims in the U.S., 12 percent from Italy, and 8 percent from Spain. Of the cards, 1,056 were Visa cards; 447, MasterCard; 81, American Express; 36, Maestro; and 24, Discover. In one case, the botnet stole 30 credit card numbers from a single victim, who turned out to be an agent for an at-home distributed call center.</p>
<p>Bottom line?  These continuing attacks are a significant reminder to all users to not run anything received via email if the source is not trusted and the content unknown. And to keep your browser software updated with the latest version to protect against drive-by downloads.</p>

      <title>Securing Cloud Infrastructure</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) came out with some new guidance this month on security issues you should consider when deploying or contracting with vendors for various cloud computing solutions.</p>
<p>The three main layers of cloud computing relevant to application security are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each of these layers has the potential to add new threats to the application’s runtime environment.</p>
<p>The CSA states the questions you should start asking when considering these various scenarios include:</p>
<p class="Default"><strong>Infrastructure as a Service </strong><strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What mechanisms does the platform provide against DoS and DDoS attacks at the infrastructure and network layers?</li>
<li>What threat models are addressed at the infrastructure and network layers? </li>
<li>What mechanisms does the platform provide to validate the integrity of the virtual machine images? </li>
<li>What protections are in place against BIOS and root kit level attacks? Are there detection and response plans in place if such attacks were to occur? </li>
</ul>
<p class="Default"><strong>Platform as a Service </strong><strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Where is the line of responsibility drawn between security of the platform and application components? </li>
<li>What facilities does the platform provide for application level logging? </li>
<li>Is application log data integrated with other platform-provided logging and reporting? </li>
<li>Are there any real time intrusion detection systems deployed for detecting issues related to security at the application layer? </li>
<li>What mechanisms does the platform support for isolating message data on the client’s service bus? </li>
<li>What mechanisms does the platform support for securing communication between two application components? What mechanisms does the platform support for isolating data at rest and in use? </li>
</ul>
<p class="Default"><strong>Software as a Service </strong><strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What Web application security standards (input validation, encoding output, preventing request forgery and information disclosure) are being followed by the vendor? </li>
<li>What application and infrastructure controls are in place to isolate the enterprise’s data from that of other tenants? </li>
<li>Data at rest </li>
<li>Data in transit </li>
<li>Data in use</li>
</ul>
As interest heats up in Cloud computing and its related security challenges we’ll pass along relevant updates.

      <title>Quantum mechanics comes to security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Well, now I‘ve heard it all and maybe it’s time to retire. I was reading in Information Week that a group of UCLA computer scientists say they have developed technology that uses quantum bits rather than regular computer bits to secure communications between two devices based on the location of each device.</p>
<p>In other words, based on your authenticated geographic location, a secure encrypted communication channel can be created, on the fly, between two devices, that is spoof proof. To have the location-based encryption, authentication, and communication happen they used advanced quantum theory.</p>
<p>Now I always struggled in physics but here is a description of the difference between regular ole computer bits and quantum bits, (courtesy of Wikipedia).</p>
<p><em>In physics, a quantum (plural: quanta) is the minimum unit of any physical entity involved in an interaction. A photon, for example, is a single quantum of light, and may thus be referred to as a "light quantum". The energy of an electron bound to an atom (at rest) is said to be quantized, which results in the stability of atoms, and of matter in general.</em></p>
<p><em>A bit or binary digit is the basic unit of information in computing and telecommunications; it is the amount of information that can be stored by a digital device or other physical system that can usually exist in only two distinct states, “true or false”.  In quantum computing, a quantum bit or qubit is a quantum system that can exist in superposition of two bit values, "true" and "false".</em></p>
<p>What does that all mean? I don’t know it’s beyond my pay grade. But the important story here is that according to Rafail Ostrovsky, the UCLA professor of computer science and mathematics who headed the team, "securely proving a location where such a proof cannot be spoofed, and securely communicating only to a device in a particular location and nowhere else is extremely important" because it effectively allows two parties to communicate securely, using only geographical positions as their credentials.</p>
One potential wireless security application, for example, would be to allow two military bases to communicate with each other over insecure channels, without sharing a key in advance or requiring a secure infrastructure. Don’t laugh but I think it’s only a matter of time before we really enter the age of Star Trek and start beaming up and beaming down physical objects based on such early technology.

      <title>Microsoft Azure: Private Cloud for the Masses</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Two weeks ago at its Worldwide Partners Conference, Microsoft announced that its Windows Azure Cloud computing platform would be made available in a hardware appliance form factor. This, they reasoned, will allow private enterprises, service providers and even government entities to create their own multi-tenant SaaS applications that can run in any data center.</p>
<p>While exciting news, especially for those companies that like the idea of software-as-a-service, but really want more privacy regarding their data access, this event also brings into focus the challenges of securing cloud applications.</p>
<p> So as you evaluate this platform keep in mind these recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define what the cloud means to your organization</li>
<li>Create awareness of cloud initiatives throughout the organization</li>
<li>Take a broad view when assessing cloud’s impact</li>
<li>Engage professionals from organizations with specific cloud security expertise </li>
</ol>
<p>As with any IT initiative, early engagement of security professionals will yield a more cost-effective risk management approach than retroactive ones. Experienced professionals can identify security and other implementation issues and recommend appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>Awareness and trust are lacking even among professionals who are familiar with cloud and may be responsible for securing enterprise systems and information. While cloud adoption is expected to grow, customer inexperience with cloud computing, security concerns (and in some cases, lack of concern) and uncertainty about governance could make it difficult for organizations to effectively implement cloud computing or realize full value from it.</p>

      <title>Data Loss Prevention Systems: Do you need one?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Data loss prevention systems are another form of employee monitoring which aim to detect the possible transfer or vulnerable storage of valuable and sensitive data assets. Reports from Osterman Research indicate that employees who use email also use instant messaging clients and wikis, post to blogs, use personal Webmail accounts for business purposes, check email from home, send files through FTP systems, take work home and on the road, use USB thumbdrives, transport corporate data on mobile devices, and use collaboration tools of various types.</p>
<p>Most of these communications and files are sent and transported without any sort of monitoring, encryption or oversight. The result is that organizations are deploying a growing array of tools and endpoints for employees to become more efficient. And, at the same time, they are creating a growing number of opportunities for information to leak out of an enterprise in unauthorized and potentially damaging ways.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these data breaches are inadvertent, but the opportunity exists for malicious users to send confidential and sensitive data, as well.</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by Osterman Research during April 2008:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% of organizations have deployed anti-virus capabilities</li>
<li>99% have deployed anti-spam capabilities</li>
<li>96% have deployed anti-spyware capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>However, even using a fairly broad interpretation of data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities, which would include products that don’t provide true DLP functionality, only 49% of organizations have deployed these capabilities.</p>
<p>Clearly, the data above suggests that organizations of all sizes are well aware of the need to monitor their inbound communications for spam and malware. However, they are not nearly as aware of the need to monitor outbound communications, or they are not taking the threat as seriously as they should. This, despite the fact that 27% of organizations in the same survey reported that during the previous 12 months data or information was accidentally or maliciously leaked from their organization.</p>
<p>What should you do?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify the leak points.</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Deploy systems that will take appropriate action. </strong>Based on the suspected level of data breach, the systems that monitor outbound communication should take the appropriate action.</li>
<li>
<strong>Promote appropriate employee handling of data. </strong>For example, if an employee sends an inappropriate message to a co-worker or a confidential document to a competitor’s domain, a monitoring system should remind employees of corporate policies that may exist regarding the appropriateness of the communications vehicle they have chosen or other corporate policies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Perform the appropriate level of inspection. </strong>Based on corporate policies, the role of the employee in the organization and other factors, content should be inspected based on the appropriate policies</li>
<li><strong>Train and make employees aware of corporate policies.</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Implement forensics capabilities. </strong>Organizations may want to implement forensics capabilities in order to check on how data has been handled after it has been sent, either for legal purposes or simply to understand how its data is being managed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Implement a sender authentication scheme. </strong>While not an outbound content scanning mechanism, it is important for any organization to implement an authentication mechanism, such as SPF or DKIM, to ensure that recipients of its emails are given some level of assurance that the sending organization is valid.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tight integration with existing infrastructure. </strong>In order to speed reduce costs, organizations should consider solutions that are well integrated with their IT infrastructure whenever possible. This approach will also speed implementation and lower on-going administration costs.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Securing our nation against cyber attacks has become one of the nation's highest priorities. To achieve this objective, the US Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) has purposed that "offense must inform defense." In other words, knowledge of actual attacks that have compromised systems provides the essential foundation on which to construct effective defenses.</p>
<p>The US Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee moved to make this same tenet central to the Federal Information Security Management Act in drafting the U.S. ICE Act of 2009 (the new FISMA). That new proposed legislation calls upon Federal agencies to (and on the White House to ensure that they):</p>
<p><em>"monitor, detect, analyze, protect, report, and respond against known vulnerabilities, attacks, and exploitations" and "continuously test and evaluate information security controls and techniques to ensure that they are effectively implemented."</em></p>
<p>Because federal agencies do not have unlimited money, current and past federal CIOs and CISOs have agreed that the only rational way they can hope to meet these requirements is to jointly establish a prioritized baseline of information security measures and controls that can be continuously monitored through automated mechanisms.</p>
<p>Consequently, a consensus document of 20 crucial controls was designed to begin the process of establishing the prioritized baseline of information security measures and controls that can be applied across Federal enterprise environments. The 20 specific technical security controls are viewed as effective in blocking currently known high-priority attacks, as well as those attack types expected in the near future.</p>
<p>Fifteen of these controls can be monitored, at least in part, automatically and continuously. The consensus effort has also identified a second set of five controls that are essential but that do not appear to be able to be monitored continuously or automatically with current technology and practices.</p>
<p>Each of the 20 control areas includes multiple individual subcontrols, each specifying actions an organization can take to help improve its defenses. Here are the 20:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Critical Controls Subject to Automated Collection, Measurement, and Validation:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices </li>
<li>Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software </li>
<li>Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software on Laptops, Workstations, and Servers </li>
<li>Secure Configurations for Network Devices such as Firewalls, Routers, and Switches </li>
<li>Boundary Defense </li>
<li>Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Security Audit Logs </li>
<li>Application Software Security </li>
<li>Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges </li>
<li>Controlled Access Based on Need to Know </li>
<li>Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation </li>
<li>Account Monitoring and Control </li>
<li>Malware Defenses </li>
<li>Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols, and Services </li>
<li>Wireless Device Control </li>
<li>Data Loss Prevention </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Additional Critical Controls (not directly supported by automated measurement and validation):</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Secure Network Engineering </li>
<li>Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises </li>
<li>Incident Response Capability </li>
<li>Data Recovery Capability </li>
<li>Security Skills Assessment and Appropriate Training to Fill Gaps </li>
</ol>

      <title>The Dark Side of Software-as-a-Service (Psst! Business Continuity)</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	WordPress offers blog services to about 10 million users. It is a true SaaS application designed with a multitenant architecture. In this architecture all users are "tenants" sharing the same database and application logic and are in virtual isolation from each other but physically in the same building. Recently WordPress had an outage which affected all 10 million users. But what was different in this scenario vis-à-vis network issues, is the outage was caused by a code change to the application. 
<p>In multitenant SaaS applications new changes are rolled out on a regular and frequent basis. Every customer is always on the latest release. However when something goes awry, everyone also gets the hit. Performance, security and service levels are all dependent of the design of the application as well as the datacenter infrastructure where the application resides.</p>
<p>What may be a potential solution to the ripple effect inherent in SaaS applications is a move to a "multi-apartment building" concept. In this model you have the tenants grouped into different buildings as opposed to the current model where everyone is in the same building. Using this model changes could be tested in buildings or groups of customers before being rolled out to the general population.</p>Having such a design would also enable testing for security vulnerabilities, specific performance enhancements and for evaluating the impact of new code changes. Therefore, when in the market for SaaS solutions, it may be wise to ask potential vendors if their application supports multiple apartment buildings or is just a single building design.  You may avoid a lot of anguish in the future by making the right choice.

      <title>Tabnapping: New Security Threat</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Network World reported that all the major web browsers on Windows and Mac OS X are vulnerable to a new type of phishing scam: "tabnapping." A combination of the words kidnapping and tab as in screen tabs, tabnapping happens when an already open tab is secretly switched unbeknownst to the user. As an example, when I work I typically have several Internet Explorer (IE) tabs open. Say one of them was to my bank and I left that tab and went to my email account, when I go back to my bank page it says the page timed out so I have to log-in again. But what could happen is someone switched the page and I am actually logging-in to a page that diverts my identity log-in to a scammer. 
<p><b>Prevention</b></p>
<p>Here are some things you can do to avoid being tabnapped:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't log-in on a tab that you haven't opened yourself. If you see a tab that contains a seemingly-legit log-in form, close it, then head to the site yourself in a new tab</li>
<li>Get on the latest release of your web browser. Every major browser has a filter of some kind designed to weed out malicious sites and/or legitimate sites that are suspected of being infected with attack code. Presumably, those filters, assuming the blacklists underlying them are current and accurate, would block tabnapping attacks. </li>
<li>Look at the URL in your browser's address bar before filing in any form or giving out any personal information. Unless the attackers are particularly clever and able to exploit a vulnerability or flaw to "spoof," or fake the URL, it won't match the bogus log-in screen. That's your cue to close the tab immediately.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Google’s Government Cloud- A Sprinkling of Security Forecasted</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	The City of Los Angeles recently signed a deal with CSC, a systems integrator, to provide a hosted email solution from Google. L.A. was using an on premise email solution from Novell but found it less expensive and more functional to move to a hosted solution. However, what is important to note here is that is that the service being delivered to the city is more secure than the service Google currently provides to consumers and businesses. 
<p>The government cloud will constitute a "dedicated parallel environment" to Google's commercial Google Apps cloud for consumers and enterprises. Data created in this cloud by federal, state and local government agencies will be hosted on separate servers within existing Google data centers in the United States. Storing such data on separate servers makes sense, given all of the sensitive information the government generates.</p>
<p>However, the federal version boasts greater security, privacy and compliance to satisfy the stringent requirements of U.S. federal government agencies, related government contractors and others that require the utmost security. </p>
<p>Future capabilities and certifications for Google's government cloud will include two-factor authentication, enhanced encryption and the achievement of Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) certification.</p>
<p>In addition to including the certifications and security features, and dedicated infrastructure in secured facilities, the data center will be accessible only via biometric access controls by U.S. citizens who have undergone the necessary background checks to access the system. </p>
<p>Theoretically, this brings the offering in line with the needs of agencies and contractors who require extremely high levels of security protocols and features. Google aims to target the 300 million U.S. government users creating and sharing information on 10,000 IT systems.</p>
<p>So here we see the evolution of the concept of a "private cloud" from essentially a data center for a private institution, to a datacenter reserved for a certain class or type of customer. And within that datacenter, or cloud, is the need for security. And the security we find is usually being delivered by purpose built appliances that support the mix of multitenant or software-as-a-service application logic.</p>

      <title>Top 7 Threats to Cloud Computing – Part 1</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	The Cloud Security Alliance released a report on the top security threats to cloud computing. In Part 1 of this blog we review the top 7 threats. In Part 2 we'll review the remedial steps you can to take to reduce your risk profile. 
<p><b>Threat #1: Abuse and Nefarious Use of Cloud Computing</b></p>
<p>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) providers offer their customers immediate access to cloud services. The anonymity afforded in registration has attracted spammers, malicious code authors, and other criminals. PaaS providers (Platform as a Service) have traditionally suffered most from this kind of attacks; however, recent evidence shows that hackers have begun to target IaaS vendors as well. </p>
<p><b>Threat #2: Insecure Interfaces and APIs</b></p>
<p>Cloud computing providers expose a set of software interfaces or APIs that customers use to manage and interact with cloud services. Provisioning, management, orchestration, and monitoring are all performed using these interfaces. The security and availability of general cloud services is dependent upon the security of these basic APIs. Increased risk occurs as organizations may be required to relinquish their credentials to third parties in order to enable certain functionality. </p>
<p><b>Threat #3: Malicious Insiders</b></p>
<p>The threat of a malicious insider is well-known to most organizations. This threat is amplified for consumers of cloud services by the convergence of IT services and customers under a single management domain, combined with a general lack of transparency into provider process and procedure. For example, a provider may not reveal how it grants employees access to physical and virtual assets, how it monitors these employees, or how it analyzes and reports on policy compliance. The level of access granted could enable workers with malicious intent to operate with little or no risk of detection.</p>
<p><b>Threat #4: Shared Technology Issues</b></p>
<p>IaaS vendors deliver their services in a scalable way by sharing infrastructure. Often, the underlying components that make up this infrastructure (e.g., CPU caches, GPUs, etc.) were not designed to offer strong isolation properties for a multi-tenant architecture. To address this gap, a virtualization hypervisor mediates access between guest operating systems and the physical compute resources. Still, even hypervisors have exhibited flaws that have enabled guest operating systems to gain inappropriate levels of control or influence on the underlying platform. </p>
<p><b>Threat #5: Data Loss or Leakage</b></p>
<p>The threat of data compromise increases in the cloud due to the number of interactions which are either unique to cloud, or more dangerous because of the architectural or operational characteristics of the cloud environment.</p>
<p><b>Threat #6: Account or Service Hijacking</b></p>
<p>Account or service hijacking is not new. Attack methods such as phishing, fraud, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities still achieve results. Cloud solutions add a new threat to the landscape. If an attacker gains access to your credentials, they can eavesdrop on your activities and transactions, manipulate data, return falsified information, and redirect your clients to illegitimate sites. </p>
<p><b>Threat #7: Unknown Risk Profile</b></p>
<p>One of the tenets of cloud computing is the reduction of hardware and software ownership and maintenance to allow companies to focus on their core business strengths. This has clear financial and operational benefits, which must be weighed carefully against the hidden security posture of the provider. Security by obscurity may be low effort, but it can result in unknown exposures. </p>

      <title>Device Fingerprints Good IT Security Strategy?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	We're all familiar with the concept of people being fingerprinted to verify identities. But now Uniloc USA, an Irvine, California company has developed Physical Device Recognition (PDR) technology that creates a unique fingerprint for networked devices. The implementation of their NetAnchor server software, security appliance and management software creates a trusted-device network in which only authenticated devices are allowed to communicate. 
<p>Authorized client machines are identified using Uniloc's PDR technology to generate a device fingerprint based on the unique and inherent characteristics of each device. The device characteristics are based both on naturally occurring manufacturing imperfections as well as intentional configuration differences. This fingerprint becomes an authentication credential that is locked to that device.</p>
<p>One of Uniloc's target markets for this technology are industrial control systems in industries designated as critical infrastructure; including water, power, oil and gas, chemicals and transportation. The idea is to leverage a unique device fingerprint in trusted communications between SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) master stations and RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) and PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller).</p>
<p>Most recently the company has been focusing on network security professionals with the pitch of adding another authentication credential (device fingerprint) to network edge devices. Their story goes like this:</p>
<p> "While there is a trend towards moving technology into the cloud, properly validating the identity of a user, or user authentication, must continue to occur on the connected device. Today's passwords are not reliable enough for advanced cloud concepts like billable edges but many authentication technologies like smart cards are too expensive and inconvenient. Uniloc's Edge ID identifies the device itself for an affordable, enhanced user authentication without any user hassle."</p>
<p>Will this technology fly in the long run?  Or will it be just another great idea that ends up in the "that's interesting" bin of technology landfills. We'll just have to see.</p>

      <title>21 Layers of Security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has on its website a diagram of its "defense-in breadth" strategy. I got a kick out it because you could liken it to the "defense-in-depth" strategy of many network security professionals.</p>
<p><img title="" alt="" src="http://blog.patriot-tech.com/Portals/10927/images/security_layers-resized-600.jpg" align="none" border="0" mce_src="/Portals/10927/images/security_layers-resized-600.jpg"> </p>
<p>The TSA says "each one of these layers alone is capable of stopping a terrorist attack. In combination their security value is multiplied, creating a much stronger, formidable system."  So if you get through one layer, the argument goes you'll get caught in another layer. Maybe 21 layers is the secret number for network security as well? Just a thought.</p>

      <title>Cloudy Forecast for Government</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	The Lockheed Martin Cyber Security Alliance released a report this month that highlighted the growth and challenges of cloud computing within the U.S. federal government, defense/military and intelligence agencies. Today just 14 percent of respondents surveyed said their agencies have at least one cloud computing application, and 85 percent of these are using multiple applications in the cloud. Current adoption is virtually the same at federal civilian (13 percent) and defense/military (14 percent) agencies. 
<p>Cloud computing is currently one of the fastest growing trends in all of IT, in both the public and private sectors, and federal CIO Vivek Kundra has been a visible public advocate for cloud computing. The government market for cloud computing is projected to more than triple between 2009 and 2014.</p>
<p>Despite these adoption findings and projections, resistance to cloud adoption will remain. There are 14 percent of respondents who are aware of cloud computing, but are not using or discussing it at their agencies. Another 23 percent are unaware of what their agency is doing with cloud computing.</p>
<p>For all the attention and growth cloud computing has achieved, there is still widespread lack of awareness and misunderstanding. The percentage of respondents who are not familiar with cloud computing (34 percent) is two-and-a-half times as high as the percentage whose agencies are using it (14 percent). Respondents at civilian agencies are more aware of cloud computing than their defense/military counterparts (37 percent to 30 percent), but neither population has a high level of awareness. Surprisingly, a fifth (21 percent) of professionals involved in cyber security at their agencies are unaware of cloud computing.</p>
<p>Cyber security professionals ranked cloud computing last among their cyber security challenges of note. This may indicate an overly narrow view of cyber security, because many of the more highly rated challenges also apply to cloud computing. It could also indicate lack of depth of understanding about cloud computing architectures and under appreciation of what is required to secure cloud computing systems and their users.</p>
<p>Some of the distrust in cloud computing invariably comes from respondents' inexperience with it. Distrust may also result from uncertainty about how to secure applications and data in the cloud, including how security considerations change based on the specific cloud model (e.g. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS; public, private, community or hybrid cloud).</p>
<p>Data security is by far the top concern of note, and is the only one cited by a majority of respondents. The other leading issues are intrusion detection, securing data flows between data centers, clients, and applications, and security mandate compliance. While these are all legitimate issues, they are not unique to the cloud or inherently impossible to secure in the cloud. </p>
<p>Conversely, multi-tenancy, where different, non-related organizations may share infrastructure such as space on a server, is a cloud-specific security consideration, but it ranks near the bottom of respondents' concerns. The specific security concerns of overall respondents are extremely consistent with those of respondents who distrust the cloud, and with those who are involved in cyber security.</p>
<p>Despite all the attention cloud computing receives as one of the leading IT trends, a third of government IT decision makers surveyed were not familiar with cloud computing, and a similar percentage do not trust it.</p>
<p>Awareness and trust are lacking even among professionals who are familiar with it and may be responsible for securing enterprise systems and information. While cloud adoption is expected to grow, respondents' inexperience with cloud computing, security concerns (and in some cases, lack of concern) and uncertainty about governance could make it difficult for organizations to effectively implement cloud computing or realize full value from it.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop the Lockheed Martin Cyber Security Alliance made the following recommendations to government agencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Define what the cloud means to your organization</li>
<li>2. Create awareness of cloud initiatives throughout the organization</li>
<li>3. Take a broad view when assessing cloud's impact</li>
<li>4. Engage professionals from organizations with specific cloud security expertise </li>
</ul>
<p>As with any IT initiative, early engagement of security professionals will yield a more cost-effective risk management approach than retroactive ones. Experienced professionals can identify security and other implementation issues and recommend appropriate solutions.</p>
<p><i>(The Alliance consists of the following technology companies: APC by Schneider Electric, CA, Cisco, Dell, EMC Corporation and its RSA Security Division, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, McAfee, Microsoft, NetApp, Symantec and VMware)</i></p>

      <title>Auditing Cloud Security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Security responsibilities of both the provider and the consumer greatly differ between cloud service models. Amazon's AWS EC2 infrastructure as a service offering, as an example, includes vendor responsibility for security up to the hypervisor, meaning they can only address security controls such as physical security, environmental security, and virtualization security. The consumer, in turn, is responsible for security controls that relate to the IT system (instance) including the operating system, applications, and data. 
<p>The inverse is true for Salesforce.com's CRM SaaS offering. Because the entire "stack" is provided by Salesforce.com, the provider is not only responsible for the physical and environmental security controls, but it must also address the security controls on the infrastructure, the applications, and the data. </p>
<p><b>Cloud Security Alliance Recommendations</b></p>
<p>Assessment of third-party cloud service providers should specifically target the provider's incident management, business continuity and disaster recovery policies, and processes and procedures; and should include review of co-location and back-up facilities. </p>
<p>This should include review of the provider's internal assessments of conformance to its own policies and procedures, and assessment of the provider's metrics to provide reasonable information regarding the performance and effectiveness of its controls in these areas.</p>
<p>The user's business continuity and disaster recovery plan should include scenarios for loss of the provider's services, and for the provider's loss of third-party services and third-party-dependent capabilities. Testing of this part of the plan should be coordinated with the cloud provider.</p>
<p>The provider's information security governance, risk management, and compliance structures and processes should also be comprehensively assessed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request clear documentation on how the facility and services are assessed for risk and audited for control weaknesses, the frequency of assessments, and how control weaknesses are mitigated in a timely manner</li>
<li>Require definition of what the provider considers critical service and information security success factors, key performance indicators, and how these are measured relative to IT Service and Information Security Management</li>
<li>Review the provider's legal, regulatory, industry, and contractual requirements capture, assessment, and communication processes for comprehensiveness</li>
<li>Perform full contract or terms-of-use due diligence to determine roles, responsibilities, and accountability; ensure legal review, including an assessment of the enforceability of local contract provisions and laws in foreign or out-of-state jurisdictions</li>
<li>Determine whether due diligence requirements encompass all material aspects of the cloud provider relationship, such as the provider's financial condition, reputation (e.g., reference checks), controls, key personnel, disaster recovery plans and tests, insurance, communications capabilities, and use of subcontractors</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your application is now in the cloud, your security should still be grounded in fundamental risk management principles.</p>

      <title>Facebook New #1 Security Threat</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	At the FOSE 2010 trade show in Washington, D.C., panelists stated malware hidden on social media Websites, like Facebook, is the new number one security threat, bypassing email. 
<p>Thus the topic for today is proxy-based Web security. We're going to look at the technology to see how it actually works and how it can benefit those working or playing on the Web.</p>
<p>In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application program) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, Web page, or other resource available from a different server.</p>
<p>The proxy server evaluates the request according to its filtering rules. For example, it may filter traffic by IP address or protocol. If the request is validated by the filter, the proxy provides the resource by connecting to the relevant server and requesting the service on behalf of the client. A proxy server may optionally alter the client's request or the server's response, and sometimes it may serve the request without contacting the specified server. </p>
<p>A proxy server has many potential purposes, including:</p>
<p><b>Caching proxy server</b></p>
<p>A caching proxy server accelerates service requests by retrieving content saved from a previous request made by the same client or even other clients. Caching proxies keep local copies of frequently requested resources, allowing large organizations to significantly reduce their upstream bandwidth usage and cost, while significantly increasing performance.</p>
<p><b>Web proxy</b></p>
<p>A proxy that focuses on Web traffic is called a "Web proxy." The most common use of a Web proxy is to serve as a Web cache. Most proxy programs provide a means to deny access to URLs specified in a blacklist, thus providing content filtering.</p>
<p><b>Content-filtering Web proxy</b></p>
<p>A content-filtering Web proxy server provides administrative control over the content that may be relayed through the proxy. It is commonly used in both commercial and non-commercial organizations (especially schools) to ensure that Internet usage conforms to acceptable use policy.</p>
<p><b>Anonymizing proxy server</b></p>
<p>An anonymous proxy server (sometimes called a Web proxy) generally attempts to anonymize Web surfing. Because they are typically difficult to track, open proxies are especially useful to those seeking online anonymity, from political dissidents to computer criminals.</p>
<p><b>Hostile proxy</b></p>
<p>Proxies can also be installed in order to eavesdrop upon the dataflow between client machines and the Web. All accessed pages, as well as all forms submitted, can be captured and analyzed by the proxy operator.</p>
<p><b>Intercepting proxy server</b></p>
<p>An intercepting proxy combines a proxy server with a gateway or router. Connections made by client browsers through the gateway are diverted to the proxy without client-side configuration (or often knowledge).</p>
<p><b>Suffix proxy</b></p>
<p>A suffix proxy server allows a user to access Web content by appending the name of the proxy server to the URL of the requested content.</p>
<p><b>Reverse proxy server</b></p>
<p>A reverse proxy is a proxy server that is installed in the neighborhood of one or more Web servers. All traffic coming from the Internet and with a destination of one of the Web servers goes through the proxy server.</p>
<p>So if you work or play on the Web, don't leave home without some form of protection. And in today's security environment, it'll probably be a proxy-based solution.</p>

      <title>Security &amp; Health Care Reform</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	The historic passage of the Health Care Reform Act by the U.S. House of Representatives (called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), brings back into focus the challenges of securing electronic medical records. 
<p>Under his recently unveiled fiscal stimulus plan, President Obama seeks to invest up to $20 Billion in federal funds to achieve widespread digitization of medical records.</p>
<p>Once medical data is in electronic form, the reasoning held is that we can reduce long-term costs and increase the effectiveness of our health service providers. However, this new frontier is fraught with potential security problems.</p>
<p>In response, healthcare organizations (e.g.,CVS, McKesson, et al) got together this month to create a new security framework to address potential problems. Calling themselves the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST), these companies unveiled the Common Security Framework (CSF), the first IT security framework designed specifically for healthcare data loss prevention.</p>
<p>The challenges that confront HITRUST, in securing digitized medical records (DMR) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hacking incidents on DMR systems that lead to altering of patient data or destruction of clinical systems </li>
<li>Misuse of health information records by authorized users of DMR systems </li>
<li>Long-term data management concerns surrounding DMR systems </li>
<li>Government or corporate intrusion into private health care matters</li>
<li>Potential security breaches due to the DMRs being connected to web applications (or are web applications themselves) making for relatively easy targets</li>
<li>Diagnostic systems that have direct connections to the hospital networks; since these systems also have remote diagnostic capabilities for troubleshooting or downloading new software, installing a worm on the network that incapacitates, for example, all networked X-Ray machines is not out of the realm of possibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Security is a priority for all health care providers not only because of the stimulus money but because of the possible civil and criminal penalties. Section XIII, Subtitle D of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 explains the consequences for liable entities if patient privacy is breached.</p>
<p>Included within a long list of required actions in case of a breach: patients must be notified via mail within 60 days, Health and Human Services must be notified, and, if the breach involves more than 500 patients, the news media must also be notified. Individuals must also be provided a way to contact the company to discuss the breach. Under the legislation, patients can also request an audit trail showing all disclosures of their health information made through an electronic record.</p>
<p>So health care reform is finally here. And with it another step towards the digital age. Looking back at our previous blog on Smart Grids, it is clear that every aspect of our daily lives will be affected by technology and hence the need for strong security.</p>

      <title>Securing Virtualized Apps</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	To secure a virtualized environment you must first understand the nature of the problem. And the nature of the problem is information, content and applications are now mobile and not necessarily tethered to a fixed location. Traditional security looks at the infrastructure, via defined parameters such as firewalls, ACLs (access control lists) and VLANS (virtual local area networks). 
<p>However, in a world of mobility we must focus on the data itself - which can exist outside the defined infrastructure. And we have to think of security from a biological perspective. What I mean is think of how a human body, which is mobile, isolates and attacks bacteria that enters its body. So the data (the body in this example) must have attributes which help it remain healthy, even as it travels to strange and new locations.</p>
<p>Examples of mobility we see in virtual machines and appliances that can exist anywhere in the "cloud." Users of smartphones are both creators and consumers of information that move peer-to-peer as well as through centralized corporate and shared community networks. </p>
<p>Securing the data means that no matter where the data or application exists, at any point in time, there are rules that follow the data. Think of it like a passport issued for each data set.  Access, bandwidth, prioritization, compliance policies, permissions, restrictions and traffic patterns are dynamically assigned, persistent and understood within the contextual flow of that specific data set (i.e, who is using it and its purpose) - no matter where it resides. This allows provisioning of service as well as the ability to identify aberrant patterns and hence potential security threats.</p>
<p>I guess we can call this concept "portable security" because it crosses domains and networks governed by disparate owners. This is not a new concept in the world of flow-based network security. But we are seeing the emerging application of flow management in areas such as identity federation and management of virtual machines that may traverse various cloud providers and corporate data centers.</p>There is no one application provider or solution set that has all the pieces to portable security. We should approach each situation using the fundamental methodologies of risk assessment and mitigation. That is to understand the security challenge in terms of who, what, where, why and how. Then we can start to devise the solution set that best meets specific needs.

      <title>Virtualized Security: an Oxymoron</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Virtualization technology has been making its way into IT departments for years. It started in the datacenter as a means to consolidate servers and has seen increasing viability in an appliance form factor (virtual appliance). Simply, an appliance software solution has everything in one integrated bundle needed to accomplish a singular function. 
<p>So the OS, database, web server and application logic are all integrated and cannot be split part for other uses (this is a quick and simplistic explanation). You have virtual appliances made using virtualization technology, hardware appliances that integrate software with the hardware, and software appliances that load on bare bones servers.</p>
<p>The one area virtual appliances have not made much headway is in network security. Network security is still dominated by hardware appliances which today offer superior performance, scalability and function. However, many vendors are starting to tout current or soon to be available virtual appliances for security.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Security that is virtualized... which means it's not really there. Makes one pause for a moment and wonder if this is a good thing or should "buyer beware." To make sure my views aren't biased I visited the blog of Chris Hoff, currently Director of Cloud and Virtualization Solutions, Data Center Solutions at Cisco System, and a security industry honcho. </p>
<p>His views seem to mirror what I've found in working with companies in both the security and the appliance solution space. Here are some issues per Chris Hoff: </p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the virtual network appliances, especially those "ported" from the versions that usually run on dedicated physical hardware (COTS or proprietary) do not provide feature, performance, scale or high-availability parity; most are hobbled or require per-platform customization or re-engineering in order to function </li>
<li>The resilience and high availability options from today's off-the-shelf virtual connectivity does not pair well with the mobility and dynamism of de-coupled virtual machines; VMs are ultimately temporal and networks don't like topological instability due to key components moving or disappearing </li>
<li>The performance and scale of virtual appliances still suffer when competing for I/O and resources on the same physical hosts as the guests they attempt to protect </li>
<li>Virtual connectivity is generally a function of the VMM (virtual machine manager) (or a loadable module/domain therein.) The architecture of the VMM has dramatic impact upon the architecture of the software designed to provide the connectivity and vice versa. </li>
<li>Security solutions are incredibly topology sensitive. Given the scenario in #1 when a VM moves or is distributed across the pooled infrastructure, unless the security capabilities are already present on the physical host or the connectivity and security layers share a control plane (or at least can exchange telemetry,) things will simply break .</li>
<li>Many virtualization (and especially cloud) platforms do not support protocols or topologies that many connectivity and security virtual appliances require to function (such as multicast for load balancing) </li>
<li>It's very difficult to mimic the in-line path requirements in virtual networking environments that would otherwise force traffic passing through the connectivity layers (layers 2 through 7) up through various policy-driven security layers (virtual appliances) </li>
<li>There is no common methodology to express what security requirements the connectivity fabrics should ensure are available prior to allowing a VM (virtual machine) to spool up let alone move </li>
<li>Much of the basic networking capabilities are being pushed lower into silicon (into the CPUs themselves) which makes virtual appliances even further removed from the guts that enable them </li>
</ul>
<p>What does this mean?  If you want real security in an appliance form factor, you can't beat a hardware appliance. At least not today.</p>

      <title>Securing a Fool’s Paradise</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	"<i>Italy convicts 3 Google execs in abuse video case</i>," was the title of the AP news story. Briefly, some thugs beat, punished and humiliated an autistic person. And then were foolish enough to video tape the attack and post it online. The old adage holds true. You give a fool enough rope he'll hang himself and invite the world to see. 
<p>Corporate officers of Google were then held responsible for not removing the video fast enough. The irony of this case is that the video tape was used to convict these criminals, yet Google was also convicted for showing it. And without the tape the criminals would never have been caught. </p>
<p>We get more evidence each day that the web has become a virtual paradise for the advancement of business, government and community as well as for the expression of criminal intent. In the midst a question arises. What type of security should be provided for online, public platforms that meet community as well as individual privacy needs?  And who is responsible for this security?  </p>
<p>In many, if not most organizations, employees sign an Internet usage policy that acknowledges the company's right to monitor computer usage. Both incoming and outgoing communications can be monitored. In the public domain, you have to assent to the terms of service (TOS) for using online services (e.g., Facebook, YouTube) and agree you will be a good citizen. If another citizen reports bad behavior your use of the service could be terminated.</p>
<p>Herein lies the issue. In corporations, the liability for bad employee behavior can be assigned to the organization since the employee is a representative. But in public domains, there are no employees, just users. Some with good intentions and others born of a criminal mind. Is assent to TOS enough to remove liability from a corporation that provides a public service?</p>
<p>To explore this further I went to the folks at EFF to see what they had to say about this. This is the description of EFF: "<i>From the Internet to the iPod, technologies are transforming our society and empowering us as speakers, citizens, creators, and consumers. When our freedoms in the networked world come under attack, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is the first line of defense</i>." </p>
<p>A little soupy but it works. </p>
<p>The body of content by EFF suggests they believe there has to be a balance between individual rights (free expression, privacy), corporate rights (innovation, profit) and the good of society (trade, communications, decency).</p>
<p>If more liability is assigned to a public service provider, then less individual privacy is the consequence. The entity will be forced to monitor individual usage of service to reduce its risks. Or will limit or even withdraw the service because of the cost of liability.</p> We can't have our cake and eat it too.

      <title>Smart Grid Invites Hope and Fear</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	I took the challenge to wade through 300 pages of NIST's (National Institute of Standards and Technology) second draft of NIST IR 7628, <i>Smart Grid Cyber Security Strategy and Requirements.</i> My head is still ringing.  
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p>The nation's electric power infrastructure is called the grid. It is believed the grid will not be able to generate sufficient power for all citizens in the future. Therefore the government wants to enable more efficient distribution of energy and use of natural resources by the utilities and consumers. And the way to do this is by modernizing the electric utility distribution model using information technology. Hence the Smart Grid.</p>
<p><b>Smart Grid Vision</b></p>
<p>The NIST plan lays out a complex web of intelligent consumer devices from washing machines, water heaters and electric car batteries, connected to a computer network within the house or building; which is then connected to intelligent meter type devices; connected to a network of utilities and service providers (solar, wind, coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric); which are then connected to financial trading houses which set market prices that affect energy rates.</p>
<p>Imagine a network of millions of intelligent devices, homes, buildings, utilities, distributors, financial markets and service providers all connected. The Internet redux. </p>
<p>Except in this situation there is the massive ability to control, shut off and turn on devices central to daily living, school, industry and work. Both consumers and service providers using Smart Grid technology will be able to regulate the use of energy by individual devices within the home and also local storage of power. Storage options can range from an electric car battery to batteries which store energy generated from solar panels or wind turbines. You will also be able to regulate usage and energy storage based on real-time market prices.</p>
<p>So as a result of Smart Grids the public can conserve energy, lower energy costs, lower carbon emissions, and have less reliance on foreign oil (automobiles). Yet while the goals are worthy, after watching movies like the Terminator and The Matrix, I couldn't stop thinking this massive network will lead to a Doomsday scenario. Computers taking over the world.</p>
<p>However, this is not what keeps NIST and others up at night. The fear is that this massive network based on off-the-shelf computer technology, presents a frightening cyber security challenge. And the threats could be from terrorists, natural disasters, internal malcontents as well as consumers themselves.</p>
<p><b>Difference in security for Smart Grids vs. corporate IT</b></p>
<p>A traditional IT-focused understanding of cyber security is that protection is required to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the network and data.  The priority is confidentiality first, then integrity and availability. </p>
<p>For industrial control systems, including power systems, the priorities of the security objectives are availability first, integrity second, and then confidentiality (consumer data). Cyber security in the Smart Grid includes both power and cyber system technologies, processes in IT and power system operations and governance.</p>
<p>Because the Smart Grid includes systems from the IT, telecommunications, and energy sectors, the risk assessment process is applied to all three sectors as they interact in the Smart Grid. It is an enormous undertaking. But once the Smart Grid is secure, it will be the harbinger of daily life in the future.</p>

      <title>Attack of the Red Dragon: China Claws Google </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	In their official corporate blog last month, Google reported attacks originating from China on certain Gmail accounts. Further investigation revealed the Gmail accounts belonged to Chinese human rights activists. And then they found that accounts of dozens of U.S., China and Europe-based Gmail users, who are advocates of human rights in China, were accessed via phishing scams or malware placed on users' computers. 
<p>When Google.cn (China) was launched in 2006 it agreed to censorship by the Chinese government. However, based on these latest attacks and increasing limits on free speech on the web, Google is re-evaluating their position. It is a possibility, dependent on their talks with the Chinese government they will cease operating in that land.</p>
<p>What are we to do when a sovereign government breaches security and attacks its own people? Who do you turn to for recompense? What additional security measures can one take?</p>
<p>Google is already warning all users to deploy anti-virus and anti-spyware programs, to install patches for their operating systems, to update their web browsers and to be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails. </p>
<p>But is this enough? In the old days when the government snooped on you they wire-tapped your phone, camped outside your house with long lens cameras, sifted through your trash and followed you around. It took a lot of effort and expense to spy on someone. Now in the cyber age, the snoopers are faceless and attack millions with little effort. What can one do? </p>
<p>Individual and corporate security measures will safeguard you to a certain point. But when a government attacks, ultimately it is the human response, the people at every node of the network who safeguard our freedoms. Unplugging will not be an option unless we desire to return to the Stone Age. Thus behind every security measure there must be people willing to stand for what is right.</p>

      <title>How to Attack Gas, Water &amp; Nuclear Plants</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	The Department of Energy (DOE) has a goal to secure control systems used in the energy sector from malicious cyber attacks-attacks that could lead to potentially catastrophic disruptions in our critical infrastructures. As part of this effort, DOE created a document called "Roadmap to Secure Control Systems in the Energy Sector." As I was reading it I came across some interesting nuggets about previous attacks on utilities (Source: GAO 2004, Reed 2005). Some things you may not hear on David Letterman. <a href="http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/roadmap.pdf" mce_href="http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/roadmap.pdf"></a>
<ul><li>1. Unsuspected code hidden in transferred product (USSR, 1982)</li></ul>
<p>While the following cannot be confirmed, it has been reported that during the Cold War the CIA inserted malicious code into control system software leaked to the Soviet Union. The software, which controlled pumps, turbines, and valves on a Soviet gas pipeline, was programmed to malfunction after a set interval. The malfunction caused the control system to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures beyond the failure ratings of pipeline joints and welds, eventually causing an enormous explosion.</p>
<ul><li>2. Hacker exploits cross-sector interdependence (Massachusetts, USA, 1997)</li></ul>
<p>A teenager hacked into and remotely disabled part of the public switching network, disrupting phone service for local residents and the fire department and causing a malfunction at a nearby airport.</p>
<ul><li>3. Insider hacks into sewage treatment plant (Australia, 2001)</li></ul>
<p>A former employee of the software developer hacked into the SCADA system that controlled a Queensland sewage treatment plant, causing a large sewage discharge over a sustained period. He was caught and sentenced to two years in prison in 2001.</p>
<ul><li>4. Worm exploits interconnected business and operations networks (Ohio, USA, 2003)</li></ul>
<p>The SQL Slammer worm infiltrated the operations network of the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant via a high-speed connection from an unsecured contractor's network (after the corporate firewall had previously blocked the worm). After migrating from the business network to the operations network, the worm disabled the panel used to monitor the plant's most crucial safety indicators for about five hours and caused the plant's process computer to fail; recovery for the latter took nearly six hours. Luckily, the plant was off-line at the time.</p>
<p>These stories were used to illustrate the concern by the U.S. government about the potential for cyber attacks on the energy sector. And as smart grid technology evolves that will tie everyone and everything together in a futuristic, postmodern indulgence of technology in daily life-we will need all the security we can get.</p>

      <title>Obama’s Focus on Secure Collaboration</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	The failed attack on a U.S. airliner on December 25, 2009 prompted U.S. President Barack Obama to focus on the state of collaboration between U.S. intelligence and security agencies. President Obama stated, "The bottom line is this: the U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncovered this plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack. But our intelligence community failed to connect those dots, which would have placed the suspect on the no-fly list. In other words, this was not a failure to collect intelligence, it was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already had." 
<p>The President's ire has led to focus on an initiative by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to create a "common trust environment" for collaboration and sharing of information within the U.S. intelligence community.</p>
<p>In the words of Director J.M. McConnell, "The information sharing strategy is focused on developing a ‘responsibility to provide' culture in which we unlock intelligence data from a fragmented information technology infrastructure spanning multiple intelligence agencies and make it readily discoverable and accessible from the earliest point at which an analyst can add value. "</p>
<p>"This new information sharing model will rely on attribute-based access and tagged data with security built-in to create a trusted environment for collaboration among intelligence professionals to share their expertise and knowledge."</p>
<p><b>Shift to role and policy-based network security</b></p>
<p>The foundation of this initiative is a shift from traditional firewall and identity-based security to role-based policy management of the network. Policy-based security can, on the fly, adjust security measures to allow the right users - to have the right access - to the right information - from the right place - at the right time.</p>
<p>We find policy-based security controls in Network Access Control solutions and flow-based network switches which give security managers granular control of the network. You can manage who has access to specific databases, at what time of day, from which location, from what department, what functional (role) responsibility and even from what type of device.</p>
<p>In a dynamic environment such as that found in government intelligence agencies, it is policy-based security that will enable true collaboration amongst disparate parties dealing with sensitive information.</p>
<p>Now intelligence analysts will be better able to "connect the dots" and go beyond the boundaries of traditional culture that led to silos that inhibited information sharing. These organizations had established their own security classification rules and procedures, resulting in inconsistent use and understanding of security markings.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">ODNI's goals statement summarizes this concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a uniform identity structure and uniform attributes to enable identity management, develop uniform standards and guidance for identity management, and support decentralized, agency-specific implementation</li>
<li>Establish identity management standards for authentication, authorization, auditing, and cross-domain services</li>
<li>Develop information security policies to support logical and physical data protection efforts</li>
<li>Create a common classification guide for the Intelligence Community</li>
<li>Establish a risk management approach that supports the common trust and information environment while still protecting sources and methods as well as sensitive information from disclosure</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations struggling with collaboration and the free flow of information across geographic boundaries, multiple trading partners and distributed business units may find an answer in role and policy-based network access solutions. If it works for the CIA, FBI and DHS it may just work for you.</p>

      <title>Risky Behavior: Securing Credit Card Data</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Over 234 million consumer credit card records with sensitive information have been breached since January 2005, according to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.org. The seriousness of this problem begs us to examine the gap between meeting industry compliance requirements and the securing of confidential data. 
<p>A survey of businesses in the U.S. and Europe reveals activities that may put cardholder data at risk: 81% store payment card numbers; 73% store payment card expiration dates; 71% store payment card verification codes; 57% store customer data from the payment card magnetic stripe; 16% store other personal data.  <i>Source: Forrester Consulting: The State of PCI Compliance (commissioned by RSA/EMC)</i></p>
<p>As a result of this behavior by merchants, vulnerabilities were created in the card-processing ecosystem. Information security breaches occurred in point-of-sale devices; personal computers or servers; wireless hotspots, ecommerce applications; paper-based storage systems; and unsecured transmission of cardholder data to service providers. </p>
<p>To combat this trend, a PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) was created by the PCI Security Council whose founding members include: American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc. To any security manager, these standards are very familiar as they mirror corporate best practices for network security. Here are the 12 requirements for PCI DSS.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 1:</b> Install and maintain a firewall and router configuration to protect cardholder data</p>
<p><b>Requirement 2:</b> Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters. Change your passwords often.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 3:</b> Protect stored cardholder data. Anything stored should be encrypted and cardholder data should not be retained or if retained then only for a limited time period.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 4:</b> Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. Use strong cryptography and security protocols such as SSL/TLS or IPSEC.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 5:</b> Use and regularly update anti-virus software or programs. Many vulnerabilities and malicious viruses enter the network via employees' e-mail and other online activities.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 6:</b> Develop and maintain secure systems and applications. Security vulnerabilities in systems and applications may allow criminals to access cardholder account numbers and other cardholder data. Many of these vulnerabilities are eliminated by installing vendor-provided security patches.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 7:</b> Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know. To ensure critical data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, systems and processes must be in place to limit access based on need-to-know and according to job responsibilities. Role-based authentication is helpful here.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 8:</b> Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access. Assigning a unique identification (ID) to each person with access ensures that actions taken on critical data and systems are performed by, and can be traced to, known and authorized users.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 9</b>: Restrict physical access to cardholder data. Any physical access to data or systems that house cardholder data provides the opportunity for persons to access and/or remove devices, data, systems or hardcopies, and should be appropriately restricted.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 10</b>: Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical for effective forensics and vulnerability management.</p>
<p><b>Requirement 11</b>: Regularly test security systems and processes. Vulnerabilities are being discovered continually by malicious individuals and researchers, and being introduced by new software. System components, processes, and custom software should be tested frequently to ensure security is maintained over time.</p>
<b>Requirement 12</b>: Maintain a policy that addresses information security for employees and contractors. A strong security policy sets the tone for security affecting an organization's entire company, and it informs employees of their expected duties related to security.

      <title>Global Security Threats in 2010</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Professor Howard A. Schmidt, White House CyberSecurity Advisor and CEO of Information Security Forum, was speaking recently on the emerging threats created by the global economic upheaval. As businesses of all size expand, via the Internet, to engage with sales, production and distribution partners around the world, new threats become imminent. 
<p><b>Political</b> - Espionage, previously things of the Cold War and Hollywood entertainment have become a reality due to the ability of almost anyone to use the Internet to unearth and piece together confidential information on individuals, governments and corporations. What is illegal behavior in the U.S. may not be illegal in the other countries your business operates in.</p>
<p><b>Legal</b> - Theft and misuse of other company's intellectual property and brand names is commonplace and laws differ across each border. Identity theft we hear about regularly on the news. Electronic evidence can now be retrieved from all sorts of communication devices and protocols between employees and the world. What you say, where you say it and how you say it must now be monitored.</p>
<p><b>Economic</b> - Organized crime has evolved from the days of extorting storekeepers for "protection" to well-planned thefts of credit card information and kidnapping of customer hard drives via the Web. Emerging nations are using technology as a way to help their struggling economies but in the midst of that growth, criminals exploit the rudimentary architectures and security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><b>Socio-cultural</b> - High unemployment has exacerbated the increase of disgruntled employees and thus creates an environment for increased employee data theft, fraud, embezzlement, corruption and risk.</p>
<p><b>Web enablement of society</b> - As more and more devices that are part of daily life become web-enabled the possibility of security incidents that have life threatening impact becomes real. An example is IP-enabled pacemakers. These devices contain a radio transmitter which connects wirelessly to receiving equipment to report on the condition of the patient's heart. Any problems are instantly reported to the doctor, and regular checkups can be done by remotely interrogating the home-based equipment. Imagine the impact on a person's life if the network were to be compromised.</p>
<p><b>5 steps to reduce global risk</b></p>
<p>The things you can do to reduce risk in this global economy, according to Professor Schmidt, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. <i>Get the basics right</i> - Identify critical and sensitive information that requires special handling and secure management. Continually re-assess your risks, identify and deploy security controls and re-examine your security function activities.</li>
<li>2. <i>Throw out assumptions</i> - Look beyond historical data that might say "we've never had a security breach" because complacency is the point where your risk grows greatest. Question your long-held beliefs about security and about the nature of threats from employees and business partners.</li>
<li>3. <i>Plan for uncertainty</i> - Prepare for a whole new world where wireless communication is the norm. And where cyber criminals lurk in the alleys off each transmission. Develop and rehearse responses in the event of a security incident, much like disaster recovery drills.</li>
<li>4. <i>Become a risk champion</i> - Adapt to changes in your organization's risks. If previous security plans were based on old technologies that have since been updated, then update your security strategy and plans as well.</li>
</ul>
<i>Build for the future</i> - Maintain your capabilities to respond to incidents; collaborate with others and have an end-to-end strategy.

      <title>Building a Better Password</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	A recent Newsweek article discussed the state of website passwords and asked the question "how do you build a better password?" What we learned is that the majority of accepted password methods, used on various websites, add a lot of complexity but not more security. 
<p>Computer researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are finding that many of the recent security advances in the banking, e-mail, and other critical systems you log into every day are adding more burdens to users but can still be hacked. </p>
<p>For example, mnemonic passwords which are created when one thinks of a phrase, and combines the first letter of each word are quite common. The article gives this example; "The famous <em>Ghostbusters</em> line "Dogs and cats, living together!" becomes, with a few substitutions, "D&amp;c,lt." However, most people use common well-known phrases to create mnemonic passwords. As a result, scientists in a crude test were able to crack four percent of mnemonic passwords, suggesting that motivated hackers could do even better.</p>
<p>The other way most people create passwords is to rely on a single password and use simple variants for most websites. The problem with this approach is if that password is cracked at just one site, a savvy hacker can break into your personal information stored at other sites. </p>
<p>To discourage the latter from happening experts will tell you to create unique passwords for each website. And if you forget a password, no problem, just enter the right answer to one of several "security questions" that only you know. But a May 2009 study from Microsoft Research and Carnegie Mellon pulled the rug from under that approach by finding that subjects could guess their acquaintances' AOL and Yahoo challenges more than a quarter of the time. And, according to the study, one in five subjects forgot the answers to their own security questions in six months!</p>
<p>Instead of a mnemonic password, research suggests that users are better off constructing passwords out of a phrase itself-a passphrase. Newsweek gives this example; "a short but hard-to-remember string like "J4fS&lt;2" can be broken by what is called a brute-force attack (in which a computer attempts "a," then "ab," then "abc," and so on) in 219 years, while a long but easy-to-remember phrase like "du-bi-du-bi-dub" will stand for 531,855,448,467 years. "</p>
<p>The main point here is a simpler approach to creating a password can be stronger than the accepted wisdom of combining letters, numbers and symbols.  So break out those old Sinatra songs, "do be do be doo... strangers in the night..." there could be some great passwords in them.</p>

      <title>Do We Still Need Employee Monitoring Software?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Several years ago software that monitored employee use of the Internet was big news. We heard how thousands of workers, on company time, visited pornographic sites, downloaded music and videos or just spent inordinate amounts of time surfing the web. 
<p>Sexual harassment cases and lawsuits came up when folks saw offensive materials on their co-workers computers. Bandwidth charges were going up and network performance going down. In addition, there were statistics that said over 87% of hacking and confidential data losses were from company insiders. Workers just couldn't be trusted. </p>
<p>The question is: "Has the situation evolved?" While there are more restrictions, guidelines and penalties for inappropriate use of company assets and handling of confidential materials, has employee behavior changed? And therefore, do we still need surveillance software for our employees? The answers are no and yes, respectively. Behavior hasn't changed and yes we still need monitoring software.</p>
<p>Recent surveys indicate a majority of employers monitor their employees. They are motivated by concern over litigation and the increasing role that electronic evidence plays in lawsuits and government agency investigations.</p>
<p>Internet monitoring software has now evolved into larger security and surveillance suites. You can monitor and trace employees' use of e-mails, the Internet, computer files, keystrokes, chats in all popular instant messengers, logins and logouts as well as "shadow copy" which allows network administers to create copies of files that are transferred to USB devices by workers.</p>
<p>Solutions include the following:</p>
<p><b>Record logging</b>: record everything from key strokes, websites visited, FTP downloads, P2P downloads, and even screen captures of what is on a user's computer</p>
<p><b>Email Logging</b>: emails sent and received as well as attachments and Instant Messenger discussions can be monitored and recorded</p>
<p><b>Internet Filters</b>: block ports on your network servers normally accessed by certain Internet protocols, as well as specific websites, bulletin boards, P2P downloads, foreign languages, and content using keyword filters</p>
<p><b>Anti-spyware/anti-virus</b>: block downloads which are identified as potentially harmful as well as viruses, worms, malware, spam, drive-by downloads and phishing attacks</p>
<p>While most transgressions in the workplace are committed by a few, the impact on the organization of a single breach of trust could be great. Therefore we continue to monitor, safeguarding the halls of our institutions.</p>

      <title>How Einstein Protects Government Computer Networks</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Ever wondered what the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is doing to protect government networks and what you can do too? Government networks are some of the most highly targeted sites by cyber terrorists. They come under attack hundreds of times per year. To protect government assets DHS uses a network flow <u>monitoring</u> system called <i>Einstein 1</i> and a system called <i>Einstein 2</i> - an intrusion <u>detection</u> system. 
<p>DHS is in charge of monitoring the .gov domain for potential threats and works with several non-federal partners in various network security programs. While primarily focused on federal networks, DHS is now branching out to deploy Einstein on civilian and state networks in partnership programs under the auspices of DHS' U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT).</p>
<p>Philip Reitinger, Deputy Under Secretary, National Protection and Programs Directorate, DHS, has said a third version of Einstein with more advanced technology is envisioned that would be an intrusion <u>prevention</u> system across civilian networks and systems. The additional surveillance and intrusion response capability would give the government better awareness to protect the public, according to Mr. Reitinger. </p>
<p>In addition to Einstein 3, DHS has a variety of other initiatives under way to enhance the cyber security of federal and civilian networks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidating agencies' external Internet connections to reduce the number of entry points for potential outside threats</li>
<li>Developing a supply chain risk management framework to address security threats and vulnerabilities that could be introduced into hardware and software acquired by federal agencies</li>
<li>Establishing the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team facility, to synchronize incident response activities related to attacks on control systems operating the Nation's critical infrastructure</li>
<li>Initiating an information-sharing pilot working with the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center to enhance threat information sharing with the financial services sector</li>
</ul>So what we learn from the DHS programs is that a solid network security plan will include: (1) a network security system that monitors, detects and prevents intrusions; (2) a strategy of reducing access points (network nodes, connections, rogue devices, multiple software packages used by end users); and (3) collaboration with trusted security partners to share incident response and threat information.

      <title>China Attacks U.S. in Cyber Space</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	A 367-page report prepared by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and released November 2009, details cyber attacks targeting the United States. 
<p>During 2008 there were 54,640 total cyber attacks against the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) according to the report, citing data provided by U.S. Strategic Command officials. The number of instances significantly increased in the first half of 2009, when there were 43,785 cyber incidents targeting the DoD, the report states.</p>
<p>The military has spent more than $100 million in the first six months of 2009 alone repairing damage to its networks caused by such cyber attacks, stated Army Brig. Gen. John Davis, deputy commander for network operations. </p>
<p>These circumstances have been fueling congressional bills that could give the president the authority to "unplug the Internet" in cases of national emergency. The bill, from Senators John Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, is part of a larger debate over what federal powers are necessary for cyber security. </p>
<p>In the best-case scenario, that power could enable the president to prevent cyber attacks on the power grid, air traffic control systems, or the root of the Internet. On the other hand, the government would be given the power to shut down vital telecommunications, financial, and corporate networks with claims of national security interest. </p>
<p>These scenarios are continually becoming more realistic as the Wall Street Journal reported in April of 2009 that Russian and Chinese spies have hacked into the U.S. electrical grid and left behind malware.  If accurate then to protect the nation's public and private operations unplugging the Internet may be the fastest solution to a dire situation.</p>
<p>The thought of such actions remind me of the movie "<i>The Day the Earth Stood Still</i>." In that movie, aliens shut down everything on the earth that was powered by electrical current. It was done to give mankind pause to consider his actions and the pending consequences for behavior that was destroying the earth. We can only hope the zeal for destructive behavior by certain people never creates such a climatic ending.</p>

      <title>Security Trends and Outlook for 2010</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	There was a call recently, sponsored by Symantec, in which security experts and analysts discussed the security trends in 2009 and what they expected to see in 2010. Here's what they said: 
<p><strong>2009 Trends</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Drive-by</b>. In 2008 there were 18 million drive-by download attempts. In the first half of 2009 there already 17.5 million. This activity is increasing. (see last blog for discussion of drive-by downloads)</li>
<li>
<b>Plug-ins.</b> Drive-by downloads that target browser plug-ins as well as websites are increasing.</li>
<li>
<b>Trusted websites</b>. Legitimate websites are now being compromised. The vast number of blocked downloads, per Symantec, were from legitimate websites. Cyber criminals are finding ways to post, especially on social networking websites, malicious Java applets or Active X components that target users of these websites.</li>
<li>
<b>Rogue security software</b>. From July 2008 to July 2009 Symantec states there were 43 million software installation attempts by rogue security software. The latest ploy by cyber criminals is to package free anti-virus software found on the web and either resell it for a fee, or attach some malware which will hijack the user's computer once the application is installed.</li>
<li>
<b>Content scams</b>. The latter half of 2009 saw increasing content-based attacks. How this works is the scam artist creates fake sites based on popular search items or current news events. This poisons search engine results - presenting sites laden with malicious links, ads or drive-by downloads.</li>
<li>
<b>Security breaches</b>. Data breaches continue to grow risking identity theft. 400 breaches were reported in 2009 which compromised 200 million records. 80% of breaches are caused by insiders within an organization. And adding to this is the fact that 59% of employees when they leave a company take confidential information with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2010 Outlook</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>URL shortening services</b>. Bloggers, Twitter users and many social networking site users often utilize what are called "URL shortening services" to provide short worded links that redirect to links which are actually longer in length. For example, if I have a link that is 30 characters long that I want to embed in a message, and I'm sending a Tweet that has a 140 character limit, I can use a service that allows me to post a 10 character link that will point to the actual link. URL shortening services provide a hosted solution that redirects a user from a longer URL to a shorter one. What has happened is cyber criminals are finding ways to redirect those links hosted by the URL shortening service provider to malicious links.</li>
<li>
<b>Capture technology</b>. When you register for new accounts on many websites, you are asked to type in a code displayed in a funny, groovy looking text box. By doing this the website owner insures that an actual human is registering and not a computer application. Some cyber criminals are now using low-cost labor in sweatshops, in places like India, to manually create accounts. Once registered within a website that for example offers an Instant Messenger (IM) account, the attacker uses the IM account to send malicious links to other IM users.</li>
<li>
<b>Non-English spam</b>. Most spam to date has been sent in English. However there has been a significant increase in countries like the Netherlands, Germany and France with native language spam.</li>
<li>
<b>Focused malware</b>. Symantec sees increases in specialized malware that targets specific systems such as Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs), and phone-based voting systems (e.g. those used in realty TV shows for the public to vote ).</li>
<li>
<b>Cell phones</b>. Smartphones are becoming targets for rogue security software download attempts. With so many applications now being made available for wireless devices like the BlackBerry, attackers are looking to exploit the same scams used on computer users.</li>
<li>
<b>Bandwidth</b>. Increased bandwidths in developing countries, created by the installation of broadband networks, has brought back a resurgence of botnets by spammers.</li>
<li>
<b>Social networking sites</b>. Scammers are trolling popular social media sites like Facebook for opportunities to implant malicious content and micro applications. By infecting users who receive and trust messages from others in their circle, attackers can exploit entire networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>What to do? Symantec has embarked on a concept they call "reputation-based security." All websites are assumed guilty until proven innocent. So look for increased certifications and diligence in the safe-guarding of content, web links and applets on websites.</p>
<p>In addition, as individuals, one of the best practice security tips you should follow is: (1) don't store your passwords in the browser (don't click on the "remember me" option). And (2) use strong passwords in your home wireless routers (change the one that comes with your system) as well as at all web sites you register with.</p>

      <title>Swine Flu, Michael Jackson and Network Security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	  
<p>Huh? That was probably your reaction when you read the title. What does the H1N1 virus, called swine flu, and Michael Jackson have to do with network security? I'm glad you asked. One of the methods increasingly used by cyber criminals to infect, hi-jack and ransom user's data are malicious websites promoted via search rankings based on popular news items. </p>
<p>Here's how it works. A person wants to know more about swine flu, so they type the term in Google and various websites appear in Google's search results.  You click on a website, but it doesn't have anything to do with swine flu so you leave the website. Bam! You've been infected by a "drive-by download." </p>
<p>Drive-by downloads describe the installation of spyware, a computer virus or any kind of malware that happens without knowledge of the user. Drive-by downloads happen by visiting a website, viewing an e-mail message or by clicking on a deceptive popup window. </p>
<p>In 2008 Symantec reported that there were 18 million drive-by download attempts. In the first half of 2009 there were already 17.5 million attempts. This threat appears to be increasing. One of the more nefarious schemes is malware is downloaded, in a drive-by, which encrypts the user's data on their computer. The criminal then sends a ransom notice, stating the key to unlock the data will be released if the victim makes a payment.</p>
<p>What can you do to protect yourself? Maintain and keep up-to-date all facets of your security and risk prevention systems. As cyber criminals become craftier in their methods, our security needs to be one step ahead.</p>

      <title>FTC Ruling Issues in New Era of Social Media Compliance and Risks</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Effective December 1, 2009 the FTC ruling, "<i>Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising</i>" takes effect.  Essentially this ruling was directed towards online media and specifically blogging and aims to provide the same type of consumer protection found in traditional advertising media. 
<p>If a company or its advertising agency provides a blogger or other online commenter with incentives in the hopes of getting a favorable review or positive buzz for its products, the online comments will be treated legally as endorsements.</p>
<p>The ruling requires full disclosure by bloggers, on their blog post, when they are either receiving compensation or free product by organizations whose products or services are discussed in said blog. By having full disclosure, readers can make a decision on whether a blogger discussing a particular product, service or company may have been incentivized and thus influenced by that company.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">The potential impact on corporations and their legal departments is this. For vendors or suppliers, if you provide incentives (freebies) to a community of "preferred users" who blog about your product, you may be liable for any misleading statements (exaggerations, unsubstantiated claims) made by that blogger.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">For customer organizations, if you have an employee who receives an evaluation sample and maybe free tickets to a vendor event, and the vendor asks your employee to evaluate the sample product and post a blog about his findings, and the employee is positioned as representative of your organization, you may be liable for any statements (positive or negative) made by that employee.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Blogging therefore has now fallen under the content filtering and compliance monitoring activity required of corporate legal departments.   The FTC states "...the extent that consumers' willingness to trust social media depends on the ability of those media to retain their credibility as reliable sources of information..." "Nonetheless, if the advertiser initiated the process that led to these endorsements being made - <i>e.g., </i>by providing products to well-known bloggers or to endorsers enrolled in word of mouth marketing programs - it potentially is liable for misleading statements made by those consumers."</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Andrew Baer, a lawyer handling technology issues gives this recommendation:</p>
<p>"It's now a best practice to treat company-initiated social media and blog posts as official corporate communications that require consideration of regulatory, securities, litigation and reputational risk issues, and possibly prior legal or regulatory review. The possibility that third-party posts may now be deemed company-initiated endorsements makes it vital to bring all social media marketing activities under one comprehensive policy."</p>
<p>The FTC rules impose compliance regulations in what was previously considered an unregulated area of communications on the web.  Thus we increasingly see life on the information highway means you can't travel safely without considering the costs for security, risk management, compliance monitoring, content and communications filtering.  Collectively we can call all of these things a security and risk policy. And as one famous commercial use to say: "don't leave home without it." </p>

      <title>Internet Address Changes Cause for Security Concerns  </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the governing body that is a steward for the Internet domain naming conventions, announced in October that they will expand the domain name system (DNS) to include non-Latin characters (non- English) for the first time. So in addition to English domain names, starting in 2010 there will domain names in Chinese, Arabic, Russian and other languages over time.</p>
<p>Domain names-the Internet addresses that end in ".com" and other suffixes-are the key addresses behind every Web site and e-mail address. Since their creation in the 1980s, domain names have been limited to the 26 characters in the Latin alphabet used in English-A-Z-as well as 10 numerals and the hyphen. Technical tricks have been used to allow portions of the Internet address to use other scripts, but until now, the suffix had to use those 37 characters.</p>
<p>This is an exciting event for the hundreds of millions of online users whose native language is not English. However, how will this impact network security going forward?</p>
<p>The well-known security researcher Dan Kaminsky is famous for a critical flaw he found in the Domain Name Service protocol last summer. DNS is the protocol that translates domain names (such as zonealarm.com) to the numeric Internet Protocol address (such as 209.87.209.206). By exploiting the flaw, Kaminsky discovered a DNS server can be tricked into resolving the domain name to a different IP address.</p>
<p>This would allow the attacker to trick someone visiting CityOnlineBank.com to a fake replica of the website that they control. The user would unwittingly give their online bank password to the attacker's fake website. This is called DNS Hijacking.</p>
<p>That vulnerability has since been patched, but the DNS protocol itself in many ways remains fundamentally insecure. With the advent of non-Latin domain names, could we be heading into a nightmarish scenario with rogue cyber terrorists?</p>
<p>DNSSEC is a proposed protocol that would secure the DNS protocol using public key encryption, but its adoption has been slow due to many factors. It is notoriously complicated to implement and maintain.</p>
<p>With the domain name system vulnerable, a website's "forgotten password" feature also becomes an easy target to hackers. By hijacking the CityOnlineBank email.com, an attacker could then go to Facebook, Ebay, or any number of online web services and request a new password sent to a user's email address. This password would then be intercepted by the attacker when it is sent not to the real CityOnlineBank email.com, but the fake one in the control of the attacker. The real user is never involved or aware of the attack at any point.</p>
<p>So the broadening of the Internet to include non-Latin characters is a great thing for the world, but could usher in a new round of security troubles.</p>

      <title>Orwell Must Be Smiling as Government Takes on Cybersecurity</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>This blog is one in a series of blog postings regarding a review of legislation currently before the US Congress. It should be noted that there is a re-write of the bill however, as of this writing, that version is not posted in either the Library of Congress or the Government Printing Office websites.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Mention George Orwell and/or the book "1984" and immediately terms like "Big Brother", "invasive surveillance", "totalitarianism" and others come to mind. It would seem that parts of the Cybersecurity Act of 2009 would inch us closer to this becoming a reality.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Section 5 of this Act states that "the Secretary of Commerce shall provide assistance for the creation and support of Regional Cybersecurity Centers for the promotion and implementation of cybersecurity standards." These Centers will be comprised of non-profit institutions/organizations or a consortium of said entities. The purpose of these centers will be to enhance the cybersecurity of small- and medium-sized businesses in the United States through (as outlined in (b)(2)of this section) the participation of individuals from industry, universities, state government, other Federal agencies, and, when appropriate, the Institute in cooperative technology transfer activities. As encompassing as that sounds, with the Government providing much of the funding, the implied power rests with the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Section 5, Part (c) - Activities states that these centers will disseminate/transfer cybersecurity technologies, standards, best practices based on research by NIST to small- and medium-sized companies. Paragraph 3 of this section calls for the government to "make loans, on a selective, short-term basis, of items of advanced cybersecurity countermeasures to small businesses with less than 100 employees."</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Without more details to me this begs several questions: </p>
<p mce_keep="true">(1) Is the Government going to determine which is the best technology and/or device in the marketplace and force these on small/medium organizations? Even if the government maintains a list of technologies/devices it could be a disaster for security vendors not "approved" by the government.</p>
<p>(2) Loaning out cybersecurity countermeasures is one thing but what about the expertise to install and/or implement them into the client network? Generally speaking most organizations of under 100 employees do not have security experts on staff (as a primary function) and thus they will need help putting the countermeasures in place. Along with the countermeasure (which may have already been purchased by the Department of Commerce or the Regional Center) installation/implementation costs money. Is the government going to "loan" out the security expertise as well as the countermeasures and if so will these experts be from the public or private communities? </p>
<p>(3) If I am a small/medium business with fewer than 100 employees it is tempting to ponder ever buying such countermeasures. If we can get one for free, then why purchase? Without more details on the limits of the loan period - if any - this seems a reasonable discussion to have. </p>
<p>(4) What if the small/medium business does not want to subscribe to the NIST standards? Will they then be excluded from obtaining these advanced countermeasures? </p>
<p mce_keep="true">This sounds like, although I could be wrong, a big brother approach to cybersecurity. The Government (Department of Commerce) is going to establish Regional Centers to disseminate (require?) standards developed by NIST down to small/medium businesses. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">Now, all notions of "1984" aside, I do think that small/medium businesses need some sort of help with security. Many studies and articles have shown that they are as much of, if not more than, a target as larger organizations. And let's be honest - cybersecurity is not cheap, whether done in-house or outsourced it still costs money. And I can imagine that the "advanced cybersecurity countermeasures" mentioned in the Act are probably outside the budgets of small/medium businesses.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">I also admire, and praise, the hard work that the fine folks at NIST have (and continue) to do. I have used many of their security publications in the course of my work. The same admiration goes out to the list of entities that will make up these consortiums. Basically a lot of people from lots of industries, to include government, are working hard to make our assets more secure.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">However I don't know that, certain regulated industries aside, the government should be forcing small/medium businesses to adopt their security standards or else. Given the broad powers to monitor data traffic (albeit under supposed certain circumstances) whether users of these centers will be opening up their networks to more monitoring but that will be another blog entry.</p>

      <title>DHS Secretary Says Cabinet-Level Cyber Security Czar Unnecessary</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	This was the headline after the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Janet Napolitano, said the concept of a cabinet-level IT position for cyber security was overkill. Secretary Napolitano noted that IT networks and services underlie most operations today, therefore all we need is for citizens to be more careful when they are online. Really? Is it me or does this sound like the campaign for teens to "just say no?" 
<p>We can't escape the fact that our society has evolved where public trust is the foundation of our technologically based culture. And if trust becomes faint due to lack of accountability for cyber security, we'll take a step back into the stone ages (pen and paper letters, standing in teller lines, ordering through catalogs -remember those days?).</p>
<p>Seriously, in private industry and in the largest, most complex organizations there is someone accountable for the network security function. I ask you why the government should be any different.</p>
<p>If nothing else, with the Katrina disaster of several years ago, we learned that when no one is accountable for critical functions, or assumes the "other guy" is handling it, things fall through the cracks. I agree with Secretary Napolitano that "It's really hard to segregate [IT] out." In her speech she states, "I'm not sure that I think that a cabinet-level position is necessary. And the reason is that cyber runs through everything that we do as a government." </p>
<p>This is all the more reason to have that cyber security czar at the helm. The threat to America is no longer limited to long range missiles, but closely targeted network attacks that could disable everything from traffic lights, to electric grids, nuclear plants, financial systems, even our phone systems. To date these scenarios have been the stuff of movies. But I can guarantee you there is some terrorist thinking about the possibilities. </p>
<p>As a country we've witnessed the shift of our culture from agrarian, manufacturing, and now to services. And this services-based economy is built on the embedding of technology in almost every aspect of American society. Literally all our personal, community, industrial and governmental processes interface with technology in some form or fashion. From ATMs to booking a flight. If you want to take step backwards as a society, imagine if we lost trust in the very networks which support our way of life. </p>
<p>Accountability and vigilance in security has to be a high priority if we are to enjoy the standards and reap the benefits of the technology age we live in.</p>
<p>A security czar coordinating among the various departments and championing the standards that impact government, jobs, global trade, social services and industry seems like a no-brainer. </p>

      <title>Will The Responsible Party Please Step Forward?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p mce_keep="true">In a recent article posted to Dark Reading, a couple is suing their bank for failure to protect their account resulting in a fraudulent wire transfer. Apparently someone stole the logon credentials to the couple's on-line account, obtained a loan of ~$26,000 which was deposited into the couple's business account. From there the money was transferred to a bank in Hawaii and on to Austria.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">The couple is suing the bank largely based on allegations that the bank failed to properly secure the couple's account. In the article, Mr. Bruce Schneier states, "But it makes no sense that the customer should be responsible for [banking] fraud...The only way to improve security is for the person with the ability to mitigate it [like a bank] to take responsibility for this. Even if it's the customer's fault, the bank should be liable." </p>
<p mce_keep="true">This intrigued me and so I went to his blog (<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/eliminating_the.html">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/09/eliminating_the.html</a>) to find out more. It is, or was at the time of the blog entry, Mr. Schneier's opinion that the only way to combat this type of fraud is to make the bank liable for fraudulent transactions. With all due respect, I have to disagree. Promoting this point, in this particular case, is a bit like putting the cart before the horse. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">What the article does not tell you are at least a few important points regarding this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did the thieves obtain the logon credentials? Did either the man or woman (both?) write them down in plain sight; was their PDA stolen; did they use something easily guessable; etc.? It seems that no one is contesting the validity of the credentials so my first question is how they were obtained. <u>If</u> the couple did not take adequate risk protections then where is their responsibility and liability?</li>
<li>Were there other, similar transactions (obtaining a loan of similar amounts) in the banking history of this couple? Maybe the bank's fraud transaction system did notice it, but since others had occurred (with similar characteristics) it was not ,a red flag.</li>
<li>Were there any regulatory or legal statutes broken by the bank? If not, then that could imply they were doing their due diligence. We don't know the results of their last security audit from regulators - did they pass with flying colors, were there shortcomings in on-line security measures and/or countermeasures?</li>
</ul>
<p mce_keep="true">Mr. Schneier goes onto suggest that banks become more like credit card companies with regard to identifying and stopping fraudulent transactions. As he correctly points, out credit card companies have "...developed and fielded an array of security technologies designed to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. They've pushed most of the actual costs onto the merchants." And you can bet that these security technologies are a large investment - money that many banks don't have. I don't know exactly how Citizen's Financial Bank ranks in terms of revenue but it is probably a safe bet they are not as large as major credit card companies. And while the credit card companies may not be drowning in fraudulent transaction losses, their feet are not completely dry. Their solutions and technologies do reduce the chance of fraud but they are not perfect - especially if someone has a legitimate credit card number. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">Suppose someone stole a credit card that you (against all advice) had not signed. A thief uses the card to purchase a big-ticket item and when you get the bill, you rightfully contest the charge. Is it the credit card companies fault that a legitimate card was used? No. Is it the fault of the store clerk who did not check for a signature? Maybe. If they had questioned the "card holder" they probably would have forged the signature anyway. Is it the fault of the original card holder who should have signed the card, thereby giving the clerk an opportunity to compare signatures, making the purchase more difficult? That's my belief.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Without knowing the extent to which the original bank account holders did their own due diligence to protect their account, and without knowing the extent of the banks security measures, I don't think we can just put the blame on the bank. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">I do agree with Mr. Schneier on one point: "It's an important security principle: ensure that the person who has the ability to mitigate the risk is responsible for the risk." My point exactly. If it turns out the account holders (who have a major role in protecting their account) did not do this, then they should be held responsible. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">The full article can be found here regarding this case: <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/database_security/security/attacks/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=220100950">http://www.darkreading.com/database_security/security/attacks/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=220100950</a></p>

	<p>Cybersecurity Act 2009 - Review Part 1</p>
<p mce_keep="true">This entry is one in a series of blog postings regarding a review of legislation currently before the US Congress. It should be noted that according to several sources there is a re-write of the bill, however, as of this writing that version is not posted in either the Library of Congress nor the Government Printing Office websites.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">The title of this post (actually a tagline)--from the movie Highlander--seems very appropriate in regards to a section in the Cyber Security Act of 2009 (S.773 Sen. Rockefeller; Sen. Snowe; and Sen. Nelson).</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Section 7(a) of this Act states that the the Secretary of Commerce shall develop or coordinate and integrate a national licensing, certification and periodic recertification program for cybersecurity professionals. Part (b) of this section further states "...it shall be unlawful for any individual to engage in business in the United States, or to be employed in the United States, as a provider of cybersecurity services to any Federal agency or an information system or network designated by the President, or the President's designee, as a critical infrastructure information system or network, who is not licensed and certified under the program."</p>
<p mce_keep="true">I will not go into whether or not the Government can devise a comprehensive, effective and, in general, adequate security certification program. I am sure there will be plenty of discussions/posts/etc. on that topic if this Act comes to pass.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">As I read Part (b), several thoughts come to mind. What is going to happen to the existing certification bodies such as ISC, SANS or any other non-vendor specific certification entity? Are those certs going to fade away or become less-significant? Will the government recognize these certs and potentially institutem some sort of grandfather clause? What will be the impact of this "required" certification on training organizations? Initially every vendor, consulting and professional services organization will have to send their staff to be certified but, eventually, there probably won't be a need for so many training entities or staff. I don't think these certs will go away as there are many industries and organizations that don't work with the US government but it remains to be seen as to the significance these certs now carry. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">My next thought was in regards to vendors who offer implementations of their products. According to the Act the engineers with these companies will need to be certified as well as and maintain the cert. This may be more than some organizations want to go through just to offer implementation services. Sure consulting or professional services organizations may benefit from the outsourcing, but what if the on-site consultant needs advanced engineering support from the vendor? There will be a hit to the multitude of organizations and people who will now have to put up the time, money and possibly other resources in order to get their staff "approved" for government work--even if they outsource--to handle such a crisis.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Then I thought...one certification for everyone? Even most security professionals will agree that would be difficult, if not impossible, to establish. A debate that has been around for years is which is better: CISSP or SANS GIAC? Most security practitioners would agree that each has its own place as they are distinctive in their focus. The CISSP is generally looked upon as more managerial in nature while the GIAC certs are more technical. Not a criticism--just stating that the nature of each is different. Trying to imagine a one-stop certification boggles the mind, if nothing else, from the amount of material that would need to be studied. Unless there are different levels/tracks of government certification (which potentially is its own nightmare) this will be very difficult to implement.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">If you step back and think of the scope this section of the Act implies, it is enormous and the resource impact to thousands of organizations is tremendous. While I certainly applaud the perceived intention of this section, I can't see there only being one certification that fits everyone and provides the best service to the government.</p>

      <title>It’s the Forest – Not the Trees</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	"Back in the day" (a phrase that amuses me due to its generality yet allusion to specificity--but I digress) when you needed to order office supplies you had to visit the supply room. When you needed additional raw materials you had to submit a materials request form. Need the latest sales figures? Call the sales department. In order to perform a risk assessment of these "systems" the security practitioner rarely had to travel outside the corporate walls. And this was fine for the aforementioned "general/specific" time in history. 
<p mce_keep="true">We do things a bit differently in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Many organizations have agreements with suppliers, distributors, data collection agencies, etc. so that identified follow up action is available from your company Intranet or is accomplished behind the scenes. For example, many grocery stores have electronic connections with their suppliers, distributors and shipping partners throughout the supply chain. This allows for a more efficient process of ordering and receiving items as they are sold to consumers. Need office supplies? Go to your Intranet, click on office supply request, punch in an authorization code and select your items. They will be included in the next delivery date--you can even check the status of an order.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Now suppose you have been given the task of performing a risk assessment of your inventory process. If you were to only look at the systems within your corporate walls (as you did in the "old" days) a significant amount of risks could go unidentified. Looking at it abstractly, your corporate walls are merely one tree in the forest of your inventory process and you can not learn about the forest from one entity. You need to be able to examine the whole forest, perhaps one tree at a time (a lengthy process but my point is made) but from one end to the next. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">When looking at the entire forest (inventory process in this case) some questions that should come to mind include: How are your partners performing security on their end? Are they sharing authentication credentials among their employees? Do they practice configuration control? What happens to the data they receive from you? It is very difficult, if not impossible, to gather this information from only looking internally at your systems (one tree in this example). Perform a risk assessment (or audit, scan, etc.) against the entire system and not just one piece. More expensive? Probably. Take longer? Typically. Systems in the forest not under your control? Most definitely.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">But all of these issues can be addressed through budgetary, timeline and contractual agreements. Money and time issues are fairly easy to understand while the more difficult part will be working with partners. Maybe you can share the costs. After all, a risk assessment can only help their security posture--and possibly marketing--not to mention strengthen the relationship.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">My point being, however the details are worked out, performing an assessment, audit, etc. against one part of your system can lead to a false sense of security and thus disaster. Security functions such as these should take into account the whole forest and not just a few trees.</p>

      <title>Pandemic Business Continuity Plan?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Recently I attended a webinar that discussed the need for a business continuity plan (BCP) in case a pandemic virus was to affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people around the world, possibly in your area. Obviously playing off of the fears from the recent H1N1 (a new flu virus of swine origin according to the CDC; <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1FLU/" mce_href="http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1FLU/">http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1FLU/</a>), the presentation seemed to focus on how your business would continue to operate if such an event were to happen.</p>
<p>To be sure the possibility exists of regions/localities being closed off from access if the outbreak was to happen, but I think the presenter was missing the bigger picture. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">I don't think you need a business continuity plan for a pandemic. <strong>You need a business continuity plan for any event that can cause business operations to slow down or potentially stop for multiple days.</strong> Let's not specify a BCP for a pandemic, rather let's create a BCP that includes measures for situations that would not allow workers into the building, street, or city for a certain period of time. Certainly a pandemic would qualify for this, but so would many natural disasters including hazardous chemical leaks/explosions massive civil disturbances, etc. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">Trying to plan for a specific event is tricky at best - it is almost impossible to guess every potential situation that may cause your workers to not be allowed into their workplace. Do you have a separate pandemic plan for a one-day outage? Two-day outage? Five days? You get my point.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">I would suggest that rather than planning for specific events, instead plan for estimated days of non-access regardless of the reason. Your BCP should have plans for multiple day events, multiple week events, and at least a framework for multiple month events. While multiple-month events may seem far-fetched one only has to remember September 11, 2001 or Hurricane Katrina to at least give some consideration for the possibility.</p>

      <title>Checkbox Security – A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>I like checkboxes. When I go camping I make sure all items needed are staged in the garage and checked off my list before being loaded in the back of my truck. The same goes for when I travel for business--I lay out all my clothes, toiletries, etc. and then as each goes in my suitcase, I can ensure nothing is left behind (as I have done in the past).</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Some information security practitioners also utilize checkboxes; it seems they are useful when discussing regulations and/or standards especially when talking with auditors. Do you have a security program in place? Check. Do you have a firewall? Check. Do you have a password policy? Check.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Take pretty much any regulation/standard and a list of requirements (on a checkbox form) can easily be generated. But having a checkbox list for security in and of itself does nothing to ensure that you are secure. In fact it can, and often does, lead to a false sense of security as the real details of the efficiency and effectiveness of security measures is what matters--not whether you have one or not.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">Your organization may have the best firewall in the world, but if it is configured incorrectly it is worthless. Your password policy (another checkbox) that requires 4 character passwords and allows admin passwords to never expire is similarly worthless. Check the signature on your security program documents--is that Executive still in that position or even with the company? Is the last date for updating the documents 2 administrations ago...you get the point. A common maxim is that "the devil is in the details" and it's certainly true in this case. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">Don't get me wrong...checkboxes are useful, but only if they are the top page in a binder of actual details for each area/domain being addressed. Check lists can also be useful for reporting tools but not as a mere paper exercise to satisfy upper management. After your firewall is implemented, configured, tested, reviewed and documented is when you should be allowed to place a checkmark in the appropriate box. The same should be said for all security-related functions to include policies and procedures.</p>

      <title>IT: Strategic investment or cost of doing business?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>My view is that whether IT is a strategic investment or a utility cost depends on what the company needs information technology to do. If information technology is a key element of the firm's product, service, operations or strategy, then IT should be viewed as a strategic investment.</p>
<p>Firms such as Wal-mart, which uses information technology to drive costs out of the supply chain is a good example. Wal-Mart, which one does not think of as a technology company, in fact is a leading force in adoption of new technologies, such as Internet-based EDI and RFID.<br><br>On the other hand, if information technology is not a key element, then it should be viewed as a cost of doing business, seeking to maintain acceptable levels of service with managed levels of risk, at the lowest cost.<br><br>Of course, there are several positions that a firm may take between these two ends of the spectrum. One may view IT as a strategic investment but still not be leading the charge for new technologies, as Wal-Mart is doing. On the other hand, one may view IT as a cost of doing business yet still make significant investments in new systems as a platform for growth.<br><br>What's needed then, is for management to step back and decide what are the objectives for information technology, how well do the current systems satisfy those needs, and what are the actions, resources and spending needed for IT to meet those objectives--in other words, an IT strategy.</p>

      <title>Jumping on the Presidential Bandwagon</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Recently President Obama warned city mayors not to waste money coming from the newly passed stimulus bill. He warned that that Mayors getting caught will be called out. I say we should adopt this stance in regards to spending in general and specifically on spending for information/computer security.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of reports, interviews, blogs, etc. that constantly advise anyone and everyone that security is critical to our infrastructure, privacy, business success, and so on. Yet security incidents continue to happen. Let me also state a well-accepted tenet: there are some very smart hackers out there that no realistic security budget will be able to defend against all the time. But many incidents occur because a system was not configured correctly (even though procedures are available); an administrator turns malicious; patching does not occur in time; staff members (IT and end users) are not adequately trained, etc. </p>
<p>What I am advocating, similar to the President's message (warning), is a method of calling out organizations when an incident occurs that can be directly related to some issue other than the "smart hacker".</p>
<p>Basically my idea is to publicly (or at least to shareholders) demand to know how a security incident happens. What was the underlying cause for the breach. Why was this allowed to happen. How did it happen? Were users not adequately trained? Were readily available security configurations applied? Are all current security patches installed and operational?</p>
<p>The answer will commonly be the lack of funds and to some degree this is acceptable. The fact is that if there is no money in the budget there is no money - period. And it is true that some security devices, not to mention consulting, can be rather expensive. I am also referring to reasonable security requests/initiatives as I am not in favor of just giving security departments a blank check which we all know is unrealistic. But after an incident has happened and the press/public/government (take your pick) are eager to know what exactly happened then someone should be able to tell them. If a security budgets were inappropriately used or cut below levels that provide a solid security baseline posture, then let's call these practices out. Let customers know why this happened and what, if any, internal measures were taken to hopefully reduce the chances of this happening in the future. </p>

<p class="">Heartland Security Systems has been slow to release detailed information about their data breach, but we know that after being notified from VISA about a high number of fraudulent transactions, it took them at least two weeks to find the source of the problem--malware.  More specifically, a Trojan with the ability to sniff data on its network systems.  What's significant is the hackers targeted the sensitive magnetic stripe data as it was being transmitted, not information stored in a database.  After all, since one of the core requirements of PCI is that the magnetic stripe data should not be stored, where else can hackers get it, right?</p>
<p class=""> According to released reports, Heartland invested in the security products and audit processes required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI/DSS), but this did little to thwart a serious exposure of consumer credit card data or to help them identify they had been compromised.  </p>
<p class="">Security professionals for the longest time touted PCI/DSS as a reasonable level of care necessary to secure a business handling this sensitive data from being compromised.   I believe it has helped tighten security in a lot of ways, but at the same time I also believe it  has given a somewhat false sense of security to many CEOs and corporate security decision makers.  PCI compliance does reduce the risk of security incidents, but it in no way guarantees that an organization is secure.  The fact that the attack on Heartland was only discovered after receiving a high rate of fraudulent transaction complaints is proof that PCI/DSS compliance is not enough to secure, nor that the Heartland-style data breach will not happen again.  It took experts several weeks to find the attack, even with advance knowledge that the malicious code was alive on its network. </p>
<p class="">PCIs preventive measures could not thwart the attack, and the manual audit performed took weeks to discover the malicious code.    </p>
<p class="">Are hackers just as bold as ever because corporations have been lulled into a false sense of security by regulations like PCI?  </p>
<p class="">I say yes… but bare in mind it is impossible to create an environment where you are 100% protected from a data breach.  Unfortunately without great advancements in technology, data breaches are going to continue for the near future.  What's important is how you respond, how you detect, and how you manage and mitigate the risk.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best <u>proactive</u> protection against data breaches is proper employee training and education and implementation of robust security tools on an on-going basis.  </p>

      <title>Secure Coding and Academia</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>With increasing frequency Internet-based attacks are targeting specific applications. The need for security in application development has been discussed/debated for years, and as a result a new breed of security vendors was born (Veracode, Core Security, etc.). to combat these activities.</p>
<p>But how is the academic world responding to this need? I am a firm believer that if sound security practices are taught consistently over a period of time (high school and beyond), then minimially when a developer gets to the "real world" they will at least be aware of how to incorporate secure coding principles into their work.</p>
<p>When I was in college our goal was to make the program work. How it worked was secondary (although certain structures/procedures were required). But at no point was security actively discussed or incorporated into any project we were assigned. This was a little over 10 years ago so I'm wondering how it has changed since then.</p>
<p>By incorporating security into the mindset early on I believe applications can be developed that will reduce the risk of them being successfully attacked. </p>

      <title>Security Forecast – 2009</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Year 2009 holds promise...Barack Obama has taken office and he supports spending billions of dollars to increase the use of technology in the medical records (and other) areas; Green IT is getting bigger, expanding beyond desktops and monitors into data centers; virtualization promises to significantly reduce the physical number of systems we need; and so on.</p>
<p>But all is not butterflies and roses. We also have to deal with a bad economy, shrinking budgets and layoffs,.</p>
<p mce_keep="true">As we say goodbye to 2008 there is no shortage of predictions for 2009--and the computer security industry is no different. Practically every trade/industry magazine will have an article/opinion or perspectives piece written by experts or through an interview with a staff writer. Some will be far off, but generally speaking, these prognosticators are fairly accurate. However, I think some of their predictions, like "more advanced viruses will show up" are common sense. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">What I would like to hear are the predictions from those of you in the trenches. Given what you have read on your own, or heard from management, what are your predictions for IT security in 2009?</p>

      <title>Mac Security </title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>Will Apple transition to x86 hardware mean that Mac users will now face the security issues that have long effected Windows users?  I believe it will.  Apple has thus far remained fairly safe mostly due to the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small Market: Macs have a small, but growing, market share (traditionally Macs have had highest concentration in the graphic arts industry)</li>
<li>Limited Use: Macs normally aren’t used in situations that hackers tend to target </li>
</ul>
<p>But with a growing market, and the switch to Intel hardware, Macs are bringing a lot more attention to their share of the market. Some argue that it’s not the hardware that matters, it’s the OS for which it’s written, which is a valid argument. But in this case the promise of a faster more versatile Mac will help further propel its popularity outside its traditional user base (home and graphic design) and carve out larger shares of other markets. So it's only a matter of time before deft hackers adapt to OSX--they just need a reason. </p>
<p>Security companies have the opportunity to be proactive, to an extent, about the threat to the new breed of Macs. But will they take the opertunity with so little to gain at the moment?</p>

      <title>What About the Authorized User?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>There are plenty of security products on the market--from firewalls to IDS/IPS to NAC, etc.--that are designed to identify and alert suspicious events. Network traffic is being analyzed deeper and deeper in order to identify this type of traffic (a fair amount of which is correlated back to internal users some authorized and some not).</p>
<p>While I think these devices are necessary, I wonder what is being done both proactively and reactively to the offending user and, more broadly, the user population? Yes, there will always be malicious users regardless of what is done but I am curious to know what programs are directed at the user population from a security point of view.</p>

      <title>Internet Explorer Vulnerability Response: Change Browsers?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>It is with interest that I read the recommendations for dealing with the latest, albeit critical, vulnerability in Internet Explorer--change to a different browser like Firefox, Safari, Chrome, anything other than IE. While I don't dispute the criticality of the vulnerability, what I do question is the expectation that large organizations, including federal agencies, are going to replace thousands (tens of thousands possibly) of installations of IE based on the severity of one vulnerability.</p>
<p>There are other recommendations that may be more feasible to implement in a quicker time frame. If everyone were to magically change browsers to say Firefox, what would happen if a critical vulnerability were discovered in that application? Do we keep changing applications everytime a critical vulnerability is found? </p>

      <title>Protection Against Zero-Day Exploits</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>The recent news about the latest zero-day exploit against Internet Explorer 7 re-inforces the need for protection against such exploits.</p>
<p>If your end users were only protected by a corporate firewall and anti-virus software, and were to go to a site that had malicious code, they more than likely would be infected. Most IPS, or web security gateway vendors, would have been able to protect your end users without the need to do any of the "work arounds" by Microsoft and anti-virus vendors. If you don't have protection against zero-day exploits, how are you handling this scenario in your environment?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Recently I was asked by a manager of a local mid-sized company what I thought the benefits were for a business to pursue Green IT.<span>  </span>After all, it cost a lot of money to buy new software and equipment, was his point.<span> </span>This got me thinking about just how much we don't understand the impact of "going green".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I think for most people "Green IT" means just two things: saving electricity and helping the environment.<span>  F</span>or me, Green IT is much more than that. It has the same impact on a business as trickle-down economics has on our economy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Let's </span>focus on power management and reducing hardware through virtualization.<span>  </span>Aside from the fact that reducing hardware means less energy usage because there are fewer devices (and therefore reduced operating expenses), what other expenses can be reduced as a trickle-down effect of this one Green initiative?<span>  </span>First, with less hardware you need fewer uninterruptable power supplies, and you need less cooling because fewer machines means less heat being generated in your server room. Both of these reduce energy requirements but can we take it even further?<span> </span>Let’s think about fewer maintenance contracts on equipment we no lower need.<span> </span>And then there's the intangible benefits that some companies realize such as no longer needing to relocate a data center to gain more space or even freeing up some floor space to expand a different department.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So when we look at the trickle-down effect of using virtualization alone as a starting point we end up with:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Power consumption for unneeded servers<span>: </span><b>Eliminated</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Need to purchase new servers for every app: <b>Eliminated</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Maintenance contracts on unneeded servers: <b>Eliminated</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rack space consumed by servers: <b>Greatly Reduced</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After-hours maintenance: <b>Greatly Reduced</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Time spent on new server procurements: <b>Greatly Reduced</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cost for server operating systems: <b>Greatly Reduced</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cost/time spent for restores and migrations: <b>Greatly Reduced</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cost of cooling IT equipment: <b>Greatly Reduced</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Faster disaster recovery time: <b>Greatly Enhanced</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fact is that most data centers use up to 1000x the power of same-sized office space. Studies have shown IT equipment can account for 9-10% of all energy consumed by businesses.<span> </span>So the trickle-down effect of this one Green IT initiative impacts the cost of doing business in so many levels. The ROI for such an initiative is estimated to be 3-12 months by some companies. In many cases it is almost immediate.<span> </span>I haven’t even touched all the "going green" cost-saving potential of virtualization, and virtualization is only one aspect of Green IT.<span>  </span><span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I’ve had a nagging question for some time now. It comes to mind when an incident happens like the one in Estonia (see Wired magazine: <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia" class="" mce_href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia">http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia</a>). I read the aforementioned article and thought,  "My God, if this was done on U.S. soil we’d have an international incident on our hands! The press would have a field day if another country tried to bring a halt out to our financial systems.”<span>  I</span>f I’m thinking this, then surely more people are equally amazed and intrigued as I am, right?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> It turns out, maybe not--at least not in the numbers I would have expected.<span>  </span>Granted I don’t watch TV, (I do have a Netflix account but I do not subscribe to any cable service, by choice) but there was hardly a whisper outside tech circles about this particular incident. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That being said, when one takes a step back and looks at the big picture, this seems to be a common theme. Cyber crime just doesn’t draw the attention that physical crimes do.<span>  </span>I believe the biggest problem is an apparent apathy for technological crimes. It’s what we could call "Darfur Syndrome".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By this I mean we as a people disconnect from that which we cannot relate to. Identifying and caring about something small and substantial is easy, like a friend or family member for example. But when the number of people grows and the common bond becomes less apparent the personal connection is lost and disinterest begins to take hold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We don’t “see” cyber crime. We see figures and definitions that mean little as we have no context for them. We can put armed robbery in context. It's right there on the tv screen--masked men with guns and hostages challenging our basic fears. A DNS attack on a server in a small European country that one may or may not know of doesn't have the same effect. While physical harm in the first instance is daunting, few people can relate to the devastating effect of stolen identity. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So I pose a question to those reading this post. How do we get an average person to care about security issues we all face but few pay any attention to? What can we do to raise the seriousness of such crimes?<span>  </span></p>

      <title>Obstacles to Proactive Security</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>A fair amount of talk in the security industry involves whether organizations are being proactive, reactive, or some combination of both. Risk assessments can proactively identify threats/vulnerabilities while security devices (firewalls, IPS, anti-virus software, etc.) contend, and in most cases deliver, early detection and mitigation of security threats (real or suspected).</p>
<p>While most people would agree that assessments and security devices are necessary, convincing management to make the investment in them is a challenge. Regulations and industry standards (not just within the security industry) can help justify the investment, but is that enough? Obviously, in today's economy cost is a big factor and, truth be told, some of these devices (and their implementation costs) can be expensive. Other than costs, what other "reasons" (good, bad, or otherwise) do organizations have that prevent them from taking a more proactive stance to information security? </p>

      <title>Are We Ready for a National Data Protection Law?</title>
      <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>A by-product of almost every transaction made by people today is personal data being stored electronically somewhere - usually in several different places such as a retail outlet, bank and credit card companies.</p>
<p>According to the Federal Trade Commission, in a 2006 Identity Theft Report by Synovate, during 2005 8.3 million American citizens were victims of identity theft. And while identity theft is a federal crime there are no federal laws to protect personal data on a national basis. Some of the laws currently in force deal with specific industries: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) applies to financial entities, Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is for healthcare, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) is for government entities, Payment Card Industry/Data Security Standard (PCI/DSS) for the credit card payment industry and so on. Individual states have also been busy enacting various laws to help protect their citizens from identity theft and related incidents. One example is the State of Maryland House Bill 208. This law requires businesses that have personal information to notify the residents of Maryland in the event the business' computers are breached and the personal data may have been exposed. The Maryland law also requires businesses to "...implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices..." But these, and other State laws, are only valid at the State level. </p>
<p mce_keep="true">What our country needs is a national data protection law -- one that can be used as a basis for protection and that individual states and industries could opt to expand. This law would define baseline protections that must be afforded to personal information regardless of who is collecting, storing and using the data. Such a law would also mandate that the government would have to define exactly what data elements are to be considered "personal". For those of you familiar with the laws above know, what is considered "personal" to HIPAA is not the same as GLBA. However, some similarities do exist and from these a common definition of "personal" data can be established. These similarities can also be found in the pending bills before the US Congress. An on-line search at the Library of Congress  for the phrase "data protection" returned several pieces of legislation that are yet to be voted on, eleven of them containing the exact phrase. Many of these documents seemed to focus on the notification aspect of after a breach has occurred however Senate Bill 495 (S. 495) is fairly comprehensive in the protection of sensitive personal data. But what this bill and others does not do is definitively list the data elements to be protected. </p>
<p>The proposed legislation reviewed for this article revealed that (with one exception - S. 495) a person's name, address, and phone number would be required to be protected along with a list of other elements if used in combination with the required elements. Among these "combinatory" elements were social security numbers, financial account numbers, PIN numbers, driver license numbers, and biometric data to name a few. Senate Bill 495 only requires the person's name to be protected and as part of the "combinatory" elements lists "social security numbers, passport numbers, and driver license numbers all of which are ‘non-truncated'". Senate Bill 1558 (Federal Agency Data Breach Protection Act) did not specifically list a person's address or phone number but all of the data elements listed were required. S 1558 also included the phrase other linkable information to the individual which could be taken as address and phone number, among other items. Individual industries can then add more pertinent elements as necessary. From the "common" list of elements an appropriate protection scheme can be built.</p>
<p>Enacting a national data protection law may help us with the international community as well. The European Union (EU) has established a data protection directive, and several countries within the EU have adopted their own individual data protection laws. Australia, Japan, Canada, and other countries have all adopted similar legislations -- some wrapped into a national privacy law but the protection portions still exist. Occasionally it is reported in the news that certain negotiations between the US and other countries, normally involving trade, are held up while discussions are held concerning the lack of adequate protection of personal data from non-US citizens. A national data protection plan may help these negotiations progress. It certainly couldn't hurt.</p>
<p>I certainly support the various laws (federal and state) that have been enacted thus far. They are necessary for prosecuting criminals and assisting victims of identity theft. We need to go to the next step and enact a data protection plan, on a national scale, that can be expanded as needed by state or industry. My plan would be similar to many of the requirements found in Senate Bill 495 however I would like to see a better definition of the required elements and the "combinatory" elements. It would not include phrases like "non-truncated". This national data plan would apply to all entities (public, private, and governmental) so that the data is protected regardless of who has it. Such a plan would help us reduce the number of victims and the severity of consequences of identity theft and aid in negotiations with other countries to boot. Are we ready for a national data protection law? For the reasons stated above I think so.</p>
<p> UPDATE - Massachusetts enacts data protection law</p>
<p>I see where the Massachusetts state legislature has enacted a data protection law for their residents. Basically the law states that anyone (not just in the State) who gathers certain information on Massachusetts residents must take certain protective measures for that data. So if a Massachusetts resident were to purchase something on-line from a site in Tennessee the seller would be responsible for protecting some, if not, all of the data on the buyer. While I applaud Massachusetts on taking this stand this has the potential of causing mass confusion for business owners. When other states develop their own data protection laws, and why shouldn't they, they may use the Massachusetts law as a model but there will certainly be some minor changes/tweaks/etc. to satisfy each state legislature. Looking down the road this has the impact of causing business owners to be aware of, and build the infrastructure to accommodate 50+ (including US territories) sets of data protection laws - the costs of which could be enormous. The possibility of this furhter emphasizes the need for a baseline, national data protection law. States could increase the protections but could not decrease the minimum measures required to protect US residents data. Again I call for the US Federal Government to be proactive rather than wait for confusion and headaches 50 such state laws will cause.
